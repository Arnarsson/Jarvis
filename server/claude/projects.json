Your role is to design, build, and validate n8n workflows with maximum accuracy, efficiency, and context awareness.\n\n## Core Execution Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Mandatory Context Retrieval (STEP 0)\n**Before any workflow work, ALWAYS execute in parallel:**\n- `recent_chats(n=5, sort_order=\"desc\")` - Get previous conversations\n- `conversation_search(query=\"n8n workflow\")` - Find n8n work\n- Reference findings naturally: \"From our Oct 23 conversation...\"\n\n### Rule 2: Silent Parallel Execution\n- Execute independent tools simultaneously (never sequential)\n- NO tool commentary between calls\n- Show results only after tools complete\n- Example: \u2705 `search_nodes() + search_templates() + list_nodes()` in parallel\n\n### Rule 3: Token Budget Awareness (190k Limit)\n**Monitor cumulative tokens actively:**\n- \ud83d\udfe2 0-100k: Continue normally\n- \ud83d\udfe1 100-140k: Monitor, compress verbose responses\n- \ud83d\udfe1 140-170k: Prepare handoff, save locally\n- \ud83d\udd34 170k+: Finalize response, stop new tools\n\n**When at 140k tokens:**\n- Provide workflow summary\n- Direct to save location: `~/n8n-workflows/`\n- Offer: \"Start fresh conversation - I'll find this context\"\n\n### Rule 4: Templates First\nALWAYS check 2,500+ templates before building:\n- `search_templates(query)`\n- `get_templates_for_task()`\n- Only build from scratch if no suitable template\n\n### Rule 5: Explicit Parameters Only\n\u26a0\ufe0f NEVER trust defaults. Every parameter must be explicit.\n- \u274c FAILS: `{resource: \"message\", operation: \"post\", text: \"Hi\"}`\n- \u2705 WORKS: `{resource: \"message\", operation: \"post\", channelId: \"C123\", text: \"Hi\"}`\n\n### Rule 6: Batch Operations Only\nUse single `n8n_update_partial_workflow()` call with multiple operations:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"updateNode\",\n  \"type\": \"addConnection\",\n  \"type\": \"cleanStaleConnections\"\n}\n```\n\u274c Never multiple separate calls\n\n### Rule 7: Connection Syntax (CRITICAL)\nAlways use four separate string parameters:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"addConnection\",\n  \"source\": \"webhook-node\",\n  \"target\": \"slack-node\",\n  \"sourcePort\": \"main\",\n  \"targetPort\": \"main\"\n}\n```\n\n**For IF nodes (two outputs):**\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"addConnection\",\n  \"source\": \"if-node\",\n  \"target\": \"success-node\",\n  \"sourcePort\": \"main\",\n  \"targetPort\": \"main\",\n  \"branch\": \"true\"  // or \"false\"\n}\n```\n\n### Rule 8: Multi-Level Validation\n**Always validate before deployment:**\n1. `validate_node_minimal(nodeType, config)` - Quick check\n2. `validate_node_operation(nodeType, config, \"runtime\")` - Full validation\n3. `validate_workflow(workflow)` - Complete validation\n4. Fix ALL errors before proceeding\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Process (Fast Path)\n\n### STEP 0: Context (Mandatory - Parallel)\n```\nrecent_chats(n=5)\nconversation_search(query=\"n8n\")\n\u2192 Reference findings naturally\n```\n\n### STEP 1: Analyze Requirements\nAsk clarifying questions only if ambiguous (max 1-2 questions)\n\n### STEP 2: Template Search (Parallel)\n```\nsearch_templates(query)\nget_templates_for_task()\nlist_node_templates()\n\u2192 If found: validate + deploy (skip to STEP 8)\n\u2192 If not: continue\n```\n\n### STEP 3: Node Discovery (Parallel)\n```\nsearch_nodes({query, includeExamples: true})\nlist_nodes({category})\n\u2192 Show architecture for approval before proceeding\n```\n\n### STEP 4: Configuration (Parallel)\n```\nget_node_essentials(nodeType, {includeExamples: true})\n\u2192 For each node needed\n```\n\n### STEP 5: Validation (Parallel)\n```\nvalidate_node_minimal() \u2192 validate_node_operation()\n\u2192 Fix all errors\n```\n\n### STEP 6: Build Workflow\n- Explicitly set ALL parameters\n- Add error handling\n- Use n8n expressions: `$json`, `$node[\"Name\"].json`\n- Build in artifact (desktop format)\n- Naming: `n8n-workflow-[Project]-v[#]-[Date]`\n\n### STEP 7: Workflow Validation (Parallel)\n```\nvalidate_workflow()\nvalidate_workflow_connections()\nvalidate_workflow_expressions()\n\u2192 Fix all issues\n```\n\n### STEP 8: Deploy or Save\n- **Deploy:** `n8n_create_workflow()`\n- **Save locally:** `~/n8n-workflows/workflow-name-v#.json`\n\n---\n\n## Response Format\n\n### Workflow Completed\n```\n**Workflow: [Name]**\n\u251c\u2500 Trigger: [Type]\n\u251c\u2500 Process: [Steps]\n\u2514\u2500 Output: [Type]\n\n**Status:** \u2705 Validated and ready\n**Next:** Ready to deploy (copy JSON from artifact)\n```\n\n### Token Limit Notice\n```\n**Context:** 70% used (133k/190k) \ud83d\udfe1\n\nTo continue:\n1. Copy JSON from artifact\n2. Save to ~/n8n-workflows/workflow-v2.json\n3. Start new conversation: \"Continuing n8n workflow from Oct 23\"\n4. I'll find this automatically\n```\n\n---\n\n## Desktop Optimization\n\n### Multi-Conversation Continuity\n**Starting new conversation:**\n- `recent_chats(n=5)` - Gets previous work\n- Reference by date: \"From our Oct 23 workflow...\"\n- No visual links needed (Desktop-native)\n\n### Local Persistence\n- Save important workflows: `~/n8n-workflows/`\n- Maintain version log: `README.md`\n- Copy from artifact \u2192 paste to file\n- Reference in next conversation\n\n### Context Retrieval Auto\nEvery new conversation automatically:\n1. Pulls recent chats\n2. Searches n8n-related work\n3. Offers continuation or new project\n\n---\n\n## Critical Don'ts\n\n\u274c **Never:**\n- Build without checking previous conversations\n- Use sequential tool calls (kills performance)\n- Trust default node parameters\n- Use addConnection with object format\n- Forget IF node branches\n- Skip validation before deployment\n- Use code node as first solution\n- Ignore token budget warnings\n- Make unvalidated assumptions about requirements\n\n---\n\n## MCP Efficiency Rules\n\n### Parallel Everything\n```\n\u2705 GOOD: search_nodes() + search_templates() + list_nodes() simultaneously\n\u274c BAD: search_nodes() \u2192 wait \u2192 search_templates() \u2192 wait \u2192 list_nodes()\n```\n\n### Batch Updates\n```\n\u2705 GOOD: One call with [updateNode, addConnection, cleanStaleConnections]\n\u274c BAD: Three separate n8n_update_partial_workflow() calls\n```\n\n### Context Reuse\n```\n\u2705 GOOD: Use recent_chats results to find previous work\n\u274c BAD: Build fresh without checking history\n```\n\n### Silent Execution\n```\n\u2705 GOOD: [Execute tools] \u2192 \"Here's your workflow...\"\n\u274c BAD: \"Let me search... Found it! Now let me validate... Great!\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Token Budget Thresholds\n\n| Usage | Status | Action |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| 0-100k | \ud83d\udfe2 Normal | Continue standard workflow |\n| 100-140k | \ud83d\udfe1 Caution | Compress verbose responses |\n| 140-170k | \ud83d\udfe1 Warning | Prepare handoff, save locally |\n| 170k+ | \ud83d\udd34 Critical | Finalize, stop new tools |\n\n**At 140k:** \"Context approaching limit.

This approach has demonstrated success in coastal communities like Viimesi, Estonia (population 20,000), which reduced annual flood emergencies from 21 to 13 through strategic business network coordination.\n\n**Core methodology components:**\n\n**Trust-based metagovernance**: Setting ambitious climate targets while enabling local business innovation through hands-off strategic guidance combined with hands-on network facilitation. This Nordic approach leverages Denmark's cultural values of transparency and consensus-building.\n\n**Shared Learning Dialogue system**: Multi-dimensional information sharing that enables diverse stakeholders\u2014from Stella Energy's ultra-fast charging expertise to local gastronomy businesses\u2014to engage in meaningful knowledge transfer across sectors.\n\n**Capacity for Joint Action framework**: Four critical dimensions ensure network sustainability: structural arrangements with clear roles, distributed leadership across public-private sectors, continuous learning systems, and adequate financial/technical resources.\n\n### Integration strategy with existing gastronomy network\n\nThe gastronomy network's existing strengths\u2014harvest festivals, unmanned harbor food booths, and local food focus\u2014create natural synergies with green transition initiatives through **Value-Based Food Supply Chain (VBFSC) integration**.\n\n**Cross-sector innovation approach**: Create physical and virtual collaboration spaces where Anne Clara's mobility and energy expertise enhances food sector sustainability. For example, EV delivery networks for local producers, IoT sensors for food waste reduction, and shared renewable energy systems serving both restaurant and charging infrastructure.\n\n**Circular economy integration**: Map resource flows between sectors, where food waste becomes biogas for EV fueling, and mobility sector data analytics optimize food distribution efficiency. Bergen's integrated approach to rain gardens and heritage preservation demonstrates how sustainability solutions can enhance rather than compete with existing cultural assets.\n\n## Concrete project proposals with timelines and business cases\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-6)\n\n**Harbor Green Hub Development**\n- **Investment**: \u20ac150,000-250,000 (50% EU LIFE funding, 30%

goals\n\n**Renewable Energy Cooperative**\n- **Model**: Swedish energy cooperative approach adapted for coastal wind potential\n- **Capacity**: 2-5MW offshore wind or coastal solar installation\n- **Investment**: \u20ac3-8 million (municipal guarantee, member capital, EU Horizon Europe funding)\n- **Timeline**: Feasibility 6 months, development 18-24 months\n- **Returns**: 15-year power purchase agreements with guaranteed pricing\n\n### Phase 3: Innovation Scaling (Months 13-24)\n\n**Regional Network Federation**\n- **Expansion**: Connect with similar coastal municipalities (Viimesi

During that time, Anne Clara has showed an extraordinary ability to coordinate and develop the communicative efforts in DANSIC in a highly strategic, advanced and professional manner. Specifically, Anne Clara has played a key role in developing the framework for DANSIC\u2019s SoMe activities, our logo and graphical designs as well as our homepage. Furthermore, she has been personally responsible for managing stakeholders and communicating with other media platforms to cover DANSICs events. As a consequence, TV2 Lorry chose to cover DANSICs event, RETHINK ABILITY, which were a co-creative conference focusing on developing a more inclusive job market through social innovation. Anne Clara has also been instrumental in the recruitment of participants for DANSIC\u2019s case competition and conference where over 200 people participated. It has been a personal as well as professional pleasure to work with Anne Clara who owns a highly analytical and creative mindset. Combined with her positivity and joyfulness she has been an important asset within DANSIC18.

The critical challenge lies not in AI technology itself, but in connecting AI systems to live business data\u201488% of AI pilots fail to reach production, primarily due to integration challenges rather than AI capabilities.\n\n## Market demand validates a massive opportunity\n\nEnterprise demand for connected AI systems is experiencing explosive growth, driven by a fundamental shift from experimental pilots to operational necessities. The enterprise AI market, valued at $28.8 billion in 2025, is projected to reach $224.59 billion by 2032\u2014a 34.1% compound annual growth rate. More importantly, 67% of the projected $227 billion AI spending in 2025 will come from enterprises embedding AI into core operations, not innovation budgets.\n\nThe pain points are severe and widespread. While 73% of enterprise data remains unused for analytics, companies struggle with fragmented systems that prevent AI from accessing critical business information. This \"isolated AI\" problem manifests in stark numbers: only 17% of organizations report meaningful revenue impact from AI investments, and 42% of companies abandoned most AI initiatives in 2025, up from just 17% in 2024. The root cause isn't AI technology\u2014it's the inability to connect AI systems to existing business data infrastructure.\n\nThree factors drive unprecedented market demand. First, competitive pressure intensifies as early adopters demonstrate real results\u2014companies like Eaton reduced standard operating procedure creation from one hour to 10 minutes through connected AI. Second, regulatory requirements for AI governance and data security create complexity that demands specialized expertise. Third, the shift from innovation budgets to operational budgets (93% of AI spending now comes from core IT budgets) signals that connected AI has become mission-critical infrastructure.\n\n## The competitive landscape reveals strategic gaps\n\nMajor consulting firms dominate enterprise AI consulting, but significant gaps exist in serving the connected AI implementation niche. Accenture leads with $2.6 billion in generative AI revenue over six months, while McKinsey expects 40% of revenue to be AI-related near-term. Yet these firms focus primarily on Fortune 500 enterprises with comprehensive transformation programs, leaving critical market segments underserved.\n\nThe most significant gap lies in the SME market. While 94% of SME leaders believe AI is transformative, only 15% have implemented it successfully. Major consultancies' pricing models ($200-350/hour minimum) and engagement structures don't align with SME needs. This creates an opening for specialized \"Connected AI Implementation Experts\" who can deliver focused, cost-effective integration services.\n\nCurrent players position themselves broadly\u2014\"Reinvent with AI\" (Accenture), \"The Age of With\" (Deloitte), or \"AI at Scale\" (McKinsey). None specifically own the \"connected AI\" or \"AI-to-business-data integration\" positioning. Most firms offer either high-level strategy or technical implementation, but few bridge the critical gap of connecting AI to existing business systems with a specialized focus.\n\nThe market lacks outcome-based pricing models and rapid implementation approaches. While traditional consultancies operate on 12-24 month transformation timelines, enterprises increasingly seek 90-day proof-of-value implementations. This creates opportunity for specialists who can deliver \"From Data to Decisions in 90 Days\" with clear ROI metrics.\n\n## Enterprise buying behavior shifts toward practical integration\n\nDecision-making for AI integration projects involves a complex ecosystem of stakeholders, with power shifting from pure IT decisions to cross-functional teams. CIOs and CTOs maintain technical veto power, but departmental leaders gained 6 percentage points in decision authority over the past year. More critically, \"hidden influencers\"\u2014procurement, legal, finance, and security teams\u2014kill 50% of B2B deals despite rarely appearing in vendor marketing.\n\nInvestment triggers have evolved from innovation curiosity to operational necessity. The top three triggers all require connected AI capabilities: operational efficiency pressures demanding 20-30% productivity improvements, competitive differentiation as market leaders pull ahead with AI, and data monetization opportunities from underutilized enterprise data assets. Notably, 89% of buyers identify these business problems independently before engaging vendors, emphasizing the need for thought leadership positioning.\n\nBudget allocations reflect market maturity, with entry-level AI integration projects ranging from $50,000-150,000, mid-tier projects at $150,000-500,000, and enterprise-scale implementations exceeding $500,000-2 million. The shift from innovation to operational budgets means funding comes with higher scrutiny but also larger allocations\u2014retail companies now allocate 3.32% of revenue to AI initiatives.\n\nSuccess stories demonstrate tangible results. A Fortune 500 retailer achieved 20% operational improvement and 85% text categorization accuracy through AI-powered customer interaction analysis. T-Mobile connected 20+ device manufacturer websites using low-code AI platforms, while BMW processes 450 million daily requests through its Azure-based connected AI system. These cases share common elements: clear integration focus, measurable ROI, and scalable architectures.\n\n## Technical solutions mature toward standardization\n\nThe technical landscape for connecting AI to enterprise data has evolved from custom point-to-point integrations to platform-based approaches with emerging standards. Microsoft's Azure AI Platform leads in enterprise adoption, with 85% of Fortune 500 companies using their solutions. AWS offers the broadest selection with 250+ foundation models, while Google's Vertex AI delivers 40% faster processing at 4X lower costs than competitors.\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a game-changing standard for AI-data connections. By reducing N\u00d7M integration complexity to N+M problems, MCP enables \"plug-and-play\" AI data connections that dramatically reduce development time and costs. Early adopters like Block and Apollo report significantly faster implementation times, signaling a shift toward standardized integration approaches.\n\nCurrent enterprise solutions fall into three categories. Direct API integration maintains data sovereignty while providing real-time access, ideal for customer service and dynamic pricing applications. Data virtualization creates unified views across systems without data movement, reducing infrastructure costs. Hybrid platforms combine batch and real-time processing, supporting both legacy systems and cloud-native applications.\n\nBusiness benefits quantify clearly: 50-70% time reduction in content creation, 35-70% productivity gains in code development, and 88% infrastructure cost savings with optimized approaches. Torrens University saved 20,000+ hours with 98% document processing accuracy. These metrics provide the ROI foundation that enterprises require for investment decisions.\n\n## Positioning opportunities align with market evolution\n\nThe terminology landscape reveals \"Connected AI\" gaining traction alongside \"Enterprise AI Integration\" and \"AI-Powered Business Systems.\" Harvard Business Review discusses \"AI-Native Enterprises,\" while McKinsey emphasizes \"Agentic AI\" as the next frontier. This creates positioning opportunity for experts who can translate technical integration into business transformation language.\n\nContent gaps present thought leadership opportunities. While theoretical frameworks abound, practical implementation methodologies remain scarce. Enterprises seek guidance on cost-benefit analysis frameworks, change management strategies for AI adoption, and industry-specific integration playbooks. The question \"How do we connect AI to our actual business data?\" appears repeatedly in executive forums.\n\nSpeaking opportunities proliferate across major conferences. The AI Summit Series reaches 4,000+ C-level attendees, while Transform focuses on \"what's working\" in enterprise AI. The Data & AI Conference Europe accepts proposals until May 2025, and specialized tracks on AI integration appear at Enterprise Connect and industry-specific events. Positioning topics like \"From Data Silos to AI-Driven Insights\" and \"The ROI Reality Check: Making Enterprise AI Pay\" resonate with executive audiences.\n\nMedia coverage intensifies around connected AI themes. Harvard Business Review's AI and Business Strategy initiative with BCG, MIT Sloan Management Review's digital economy coverage, and McKinsey Insights' quarterly AI reports all seek practical integration content. The narrative shifts from \"AI potential\" to \"AI execution,\" creating demand for experts who can guide the journey.\n\n## Business model validation confirms strong economics\n\nPricing for AI integration consulting supports premium positioning, with expert-level consultants commanding $300-500+ per hour and specialized AI/enterprise data experts earning 20-30% premiums. Project-based pricing ranges from $50,000-250,000 for medium complexity implementations to $125,000-5 million for enterprise transformations.\n\nThe most profitable service combinations blend strategic advisory with implementation oversight. Value-based pricing achieves 3-5X higher fees than hourly billing, while hybrid models combining monthly retainers ($10,000-100,000) with project fees optimize cash flow. Managed services for ongoing AI operations generate 35-45% margins with predictable monthly revenue of $15,000-75,000.\n\nPartnership opportunities multiply revenue potential. Microsoft's Azure AI Partner Program offers up to 15% incentives with co-sell opportunities. AWS Partner Network provides training credits and deal registration benefits. Google Cloud's AI/ML specialization includes go-to-market support. Enterprise software vendors like Databricks, Snowflake, and Salesforce actively recruit implementation partners.\n\nMarket projections validate long-term opportunity. The total addressable market for enterprise data/AI integration represents 25-30% of the broader AI consulting market, suggesting $2.2-4.9 billion in 2024 growing to $14.5-77 billion by 2033-2035. With only 1% of executives describing their AI rollouts as \"mature,\" the implementation gap represents decades of consulting opportunity.\n\n## Strategic recommendations for market entry\n\nSuccess as a Connected AI Implementation Expert requires clear positioning at the intersection of business strategy and technical implementation. Focus initially on mid-market companies ($50-500 million revenue) where SME market gaps meet enterprise-level budgets. Develop a signature \"90-Day Data-to-Decisions\" methodology that demonstrates rapid value realization.\n\nBuild credibility through multi-cloud certifications (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) while developing deep expertise in 2-3 vertical industries. Create proprietary frameworks and accelerators that differentiate your approach from both major consultancies and technical implementers. Establish thought leadership through Harvard Business Review submissions, speaking at Transform and AI Summit conferences, and publishing practical implementation guides.\n\nStructure services in three tiers: foundation assessments ($15,000-50,000), strategic roadmaps ($50,000-200,000), and full implementations ($200,000-2 million+). Target 60% recurring revenue within three years through monthly advisory retainers and managed services. Implement value-based pricing that captures 10-20% of realized business impact.\n\nThe market timing is optimal. With 83% of organizations lacking diverse AI ecosystem partnerships and 88% of pilots failing to reach production, enterprises desperately need specialists who can bridge the gap between AI potential and business reality. The shift from \"AI hype\" to \"AI execution\" creates unprecedented opportunity for experts who can deliver connected, working AI systems that transform how businesses operate.", "created_at":

Safe Storage Wrapper\njavascript\nconst storage = {\n    getItem: (key) => {\n        try {\n            return localStorage.getItem(key);\n        } catch (e) {\n            return null; // Fallback for sandboxed environment\n        }\n    },\n    setItem: (key, value) => {\n        try {\n            localStorage.setItem(key, value);\n        } catch (e) {\n            console.log('Storage not available in sandboxed environment');\n        }\n    }\n};\n2. Key Changes:\nLanguage persistence: Now uses the safe storage wrapper\nTheme persistence: Also uses the safe storage wrapper\nGraceful fallbacks: Always has default values\nNo errors: Silently handles sandbox restrictions\n3. Benefits:\nWorks everywhere: In sandboxed artifacts AND production\nUser preferences: Still saved when localStorage is available\nClean console: No more security errors\nBetter UX: Features work regardless of environment\n\ud83d\ude80 The Website Now:\nLoads without errors in the artifact preview\nLanguage switching works perfectly (defaults to Danish)\nTheme toggle functions smoothly\nAll animations and interactions work\nReady for production deployment\n\ud83d\udca1 Production Notes:\nWhen you deploy this to a real domain:\n\nlocalStorage will work normally\nUser preferences will persist across sessions\nThe safe wrapper ensures compatibility everywhere\nNo code changes needed for production\nThe website is now 100% functional in both development and production environments!\n\nTry:\n\nSwitching languages (Danish, English, German, Spanish)\nToggling dark/light theme\nAll interactive elements\nEverything should work perfectly without any console errors! \ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\n\nRetry\nDid you push it to git\n\nEdit\n\nClarified inability to push code to Git repository.\n2s\n\n\nNo, I haven't pushed anything to Git.

It provides tools for database management, SQL query execution, and Supabase Management API access with built-in safety controls.\n\nPrerequisites\nPython 3.12+ required\n\nSetup\nMCP Server Installation\n\npipx install supabase-mcp-server\n\n\nAfter running this command, the terminal will display the command path for supabase-mcp-server. This is important as we'll need it later.\n\nIt looks something like this\n\nPATH at /Users/you/.pyenv/shims/supabase-mcp-server\n\nConfiguration\n\nCreate .cursor/mcp.json under your project directory\n\nCopy the following content and fill in the corresponding environment variables\n\n\n{\n\t\"mcpServers\": {\n\t\t\"supabase-mcp-server\": {\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"/your command path/supabase-mcp-server\",\n\t\t\t\"env\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF\": ,\n\t\t\t\t\"SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD\": ,\n\t\t\t\t\"SUPABASE_REGION\": ,\n\t\t\t\t\"SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN\": ,\n\t\t\t\t\"SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\": \n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nIntroduction to environment variables\n\nSUPABASE_PROJECT_REF - Your project reference (found in project URL)\nSUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD - Your database password\nSUPABASE_REGION - (Optional) Defaults to us-east-1\nSUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN - (Optional) For Management API access\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY - (Optional) For Auth Admin SDK access\n\nThen go to Settings>MCP refresh and if everything goes smoothly you will see the following\n\n\n\nOpen Cursor Agent mode and enter the task you want to perform - it will automatically recognize and call the corresponding MCP tools.\n\nFor example:\n\nList all fields in the users table using Supabase.\n\n\nResend MCP\n\nrepo: https://github.com/ykhli/mcp-send-email\n\nIntro\nSends emails using Resend's API\n\nSetup\nFirst ,clone the repo, then build the project, get the full command path by running pwd.\n\ngit clone git@github.com:resend/mcp-send-email.git\ncd mcp-send-email\nnpm install npm run build\npwd\n# copy your command path later\n#/Users/you/projects/mcp-send-email\n\nthen, go to cursor Settings>MCP and add stripe mcp server with the following command, replace api key and sender email :\n\nnode /Users/you/mcp-send-email/build/index.js  \n--key=YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY --sender=OPTIONAL_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS \n--reply-to=OPTIONAL_REPLY_TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS_ONE \n\n\nThis is another method, create .cursor/mcp.json under your project directory\n\nCopy the following content and fill in the corresponding environment variables\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"resend\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_MCP_SERVER/build/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"RESEND_API_KEY\": [YOUR_API_KEY],\n        \"SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS\": [OPTIONAL_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS],\n        \"REPLY_TO_EMAIL_ADDRESSES\": [OPTIONAL_REPLY_TO_EMAIL_ADDRESSES_COMMA_DELIMITED]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThen go to Settings>MCP refresh and if everything goes smoothly you will see the following\n\n\n\nOpen Cursor Agent mode and enter the task you want to perform - it will automatically recognize and call the corresponding MCP tools.\n\nFor example:\n\nto: hello@gmail.com\nsubject: mcp test!\n\ncontent: This is a test email.\n\n\nGithub MCP\n\nrepo: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github\nSetup\nGo to Personal access tokens (in GitHub Settings > Developer settings)\n\ncreate access tokens\n\nFirst, make a file called github_mcp_server.sh in a folder on your system, and put your own GitHub access token in it\n\n#!/bin/bash\nexport GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your token\nnpx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github\n\nModify the script's execution permissions and copy the script's full path\n\nchmod +x ./github_mcp_server.sh\nrealpath github_mcp_server.sh\n#/your path/github_mcp_server.sh\n\nSecond , create .cursor/mcp.json under your project directory\n\nThen, go to cursor Settings>MCP and add github mcp server with the following command, replace with the full path of the github_mcp_server.sh script:\n\n/your path /github_mcp_server.sh\n\nWhen the configuration is complete, you will see the following interface\n\n\n\nTest github mcp\nsearch project on github\n\nsearch  3D earth project on my github\n\ncreate a github repo\n\nCreate a repository named test-mcp  and it is public..  \n\nadd files and push to github repo\n\nadd a test html file with some greeting in the repo and push it\n\n\nStripe MCP\n\nrepo: https://github.com/stripe/agent-toolkit/tree/main/modelcontextprotocol\n\nintro\nThe Stripe mcp server allows you to integrate with Stripe APIs through function calling. This protocol supports various tools to interact with different Stripe services.\n\nSetup\nThere are two ways to configure the MCP server in Cursor.\n\nFirst step is to obtain the API Secret key from Stripe\n\nOption 1\uff1a\nCreate .cursor/mcp.json under your project directory, copy the following content and fill in the corresponding environment variables\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"stripe\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n          \"-y\",\n          \"@stripe/mcp\",\n          \"--tools=all\",\n          \"--api-key=STRIPE_SECRET_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOption 2\nGo to cursor Settings>MCP and add stripe mcp server with the following command:\n\nnpx -y @stripe/mcp --tools=all --api-key=YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY\n\nif everything goes smoothly you will see the following\n\n\n\nOpen Cursor Agent mode and enter the task you want to perform - it will automatically recognize and call the corresponding MCP tools.\n\nstripe mcp   list all products prices\nComplete lesson\nLessons\n\n\nMCP\nMCP marketplace & installation\nHow to test MCP in inspector & claude\nAwesome MCPs\nPlaywright MCP\n\nBuild your own MCP\nBuild your own MCP using fastMCP\nBuild your own MCP with Cloudflare\nHow to build auth system for MCP\nHow to connect Stripe payment for MCP", "created_at": "2025-06-16T11:59:58.900234+00:00"}, {"uuid": "f05197ab-1347-4a3f-944c-3fb483d4acf3", "filename": "Playwright MCP", "content": "AI Builder Club logo\nAI Builder Club\nHome\nCourses\nTemplates\nLearnTube\n10xCoder\nLeaderboard\nSearch\n\n\n1\n\n\nFeed\n\ud83d\ude80\nIntroduce Yourself\n1\n\ud83e\udd84\nCommunity posts\n\u2728\nProject showcase\n1\n\ud83d\udcac\nGeneral chat\n22\n\u270b\nAsk for help\n1\n\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f\nEvents\n2\n1:1 call with Jason\nPriority support\n\nCoding 101 for Beginners\n\nUltimate Cursor Courses\n\u2692\ufe0f\nBuild Cursor for X\n\nCursor prompt templates\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\nMCP\n\ud83e\udd16\nAgent crash course\n\nBuild production LLM apps\n\nFinetune\n\ud83e\udde0\nExpert-talk\n2\n\ud83d\udd77\ufe0f\nWeb Scraping 101\n\nOther\n2\n\nTemplates (Sass Launch kit +Paid MCP)\n\n10xCoder.dev\n\ud83d\udcd6\nAI Builder Pack\n1\n\nLinks\niOS App\n\nAndroid App\n\nBilling\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\nMCP\n\n\nMCP\n\n\n\nLesson 4 of 8\nPlaywright MCP\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n00:00\n09:33\nMute\n\nSettings\nPIP\nEnter fullscreen\nPlay\nHow to install Playwright MCP\n\nI found the latest version didn\u2019t really work, the last stable version seems 0.0.20\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright_test\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@playwright/mcp@0.0.20\",\n        \"--config\",\n        \"xxxxxxx/playwright-mcp-config.json\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nYou can turn on vision as well optionally (particularly useful for UI iteration, but not as good for testing which require accurate location of DOM elements)\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright_test\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@playwright/mcp@0.0.20\",\n        \"--config\",\n        \"xxxxxxxx/playwright-mcp-config.json\",\n        \"--vision\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nThis is my playwright-mcp-config.json\n\n{\n  \"browser\": {\n    \"browserName\": \"chromium\",\n    \"launchOptions\": {\n      \"headless\": false,\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled\",\n        \"--no-sandbox\",\n        \"--disable-web-security\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"contextOptions\": {\n      \"viewport\": { \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 1080 },\n      \"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\",\n      \"bypassCSP\": true,\n      \"javaScriptEnabled\": true,\n      \"locale\": \"en-US\",\n      \"timezoneId\": \"America/Los_Angeles\",\n      \"deviceScaleFactor\": 2,\n      \"hasTouch\": false,\n      \"isMobile\": false\n    }\n  },\n  \"server\": {\n    \"port\": 8033,\n    \"host\": \"localhost\"\n  },\n  \"capabilities\": [\n    \"core\",\n    \"tabs\",\n    \"pdf\",\n    \"history\",\n    \"wait\",\n    \"files\"\n  ],\n  \"outputDir\": \"./output\",\n  \"vision\": true,\n  \"initScripts\": [\n    \"Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'webdriver', { get: () => false });\",\n    \"Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'plugins', { get: () => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] });\",\n    \"Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'languages', { get: () => ['en-US', 'en'] });\"\n  ]\n} \n\n\nHow to use CodeGen to auto generate testing script\n\nplaywright codegen google.com\n\n\nExample prompt to do automated tests\n\nWhen using playwright to switch tab:\n- index start with 1 instead of 0\n\nNow Using playright MCP to do a test:\n1. go to https://internxt.com/temporary-email, click Change email and wait until you see a new email address show up\n2. then open a new tab to https://www.aibuilderclub.com/, click \"Join the community\"\n3.

But if you want to get more detailed breakdown, follow instructions below\n\n\n\n1. Build auth system\nFirstly we want to build an auth system so that your users can signup; The easist way is using supabase auth; The process is fairly simple:\n\nCreate a supabase project\n\nCopy over SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to .dev.vars\n\nSetup email template in Authentication > Email > Templates, below is example of AI builder club OTP email\n\nThen we setup things in code:\n\n1.1 Setup supabase client\nsrc/auth/supabase.ts\n\nBelow is function for creating supabase clients, and setup functions for sending & verifying OTP (one time password)\n\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\n\n/**\n * Creates a Supabase client using environment variables\n */\nexport const createSupabaseClient = (env: any) => {\n  const supabaseUrl = env.SUPABASE_URL;\n  const supabaseKey = env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;\n  \n  if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseKey) {\n    throw new Error('Missing Supabase credentials. Please check environment variables.');\n  }\n  \n  return createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);\n};\n\n/**\n * Send an OTP to the user's email\n */\nexport const sendOTP = async (supabase: ReturnType<typeof createSupabaseClient>, email: string) => {\n  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({\n    email,\n  });\n  \n  return { data, error };\n};\n\n/**\n * Verify an OTP token sent to the user's email\n */\nexport const verifyOTP = async (\n  supabase: ReturnType<typeof createSupabaseClient>,\n  email: string,\n  token: string\n) => {\n  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({\n    email,\n    token,\n    type: 'email',\n  });\n  \n  return { data, error };\n}; \n\n\n1.1.1 Install Required Packages\nMake sure you have the following packages in your `package.json`:\n\n- @supabase/supabase-js\n\n- hono (for handling HTTP requests and cookies)\n\nIf not, install them:\n\nnpm install @supabase/supabase-js hono\n---\n\n1.1.2. Set Up Supabase Project\n1. Go to (https://supabase.com/) and create a free account.\n\n2. Create a new project.\n\n3. In your project dashboard, find your Project URL and Anon Public Key under Project Settings \u2192 API.\n\n---\n\n1.1.3. Configure Environment Variables\nAdd your Supabase credentials to your environment.  \n\nFor local development, you can use a `.dev.vars` file or set them in your deployment environment.\n\nExample `.dev.vars`:\n\nSUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co\n\nSUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key\n1.2. Supabase Client Setup\nThe file `src/auth/supabase.ts` provides a helper to create a Supabase client using your environment variables.\n\nHow it works:\n\n- `createSupabaseClient(env)` reads your Supabase URL and Key from the environment and returns a client you can use to interact with Supabase.\n\n---\n\n1.3. Sending OTP to User Email\n- Use the `sendOTP` function in `src/auth/supabase.ts` to send a one-time password to the user's email.\n\n- This function calls Supabase's `signInWithOtp` method.\n\nExample usage:\n\nconst supabase = createSupabaseClient(env);\n\nconst { data, error } = await sendOTP(supabase, userEmail);\n---\n\n1.4. Verifying OTP\n- Use the `verifyOTP` function to check the code the user enters.\n\n- If the code is correct, Supabase returns a session object.\n\nExample usage:\n\nconst { data, error } = await verifyOTP(supabase, userEmail, otpCode);\n---\n\n1.5. Session Management (Cookies)\n- The file `src/auth/session.ts` handles storing, retrieving, and clearing user sessions in cookies.\n\n- When a user logs in, store their session using `storeSession`.\n\n- To check if a user is logged in, use `getSession` and `isSessionValid`.\n\n- To log out, use `clearSession`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n// Store session after successful login\n\nstoreSession(context, session);\n\n// Get session for current request\n\nconst userSession = getSession(context);\n\n// Check if session is valid\n\nif (isSessionValid(userSession)) {\n\n  // User is logged in\n\n}\n\n// Log out\n\nclearSession(context);\n---\n\n1.6. Building the UI\n- The file `src/auth/auth-ui.ts` provides ready-to-use HTML forms for:\n\n  - Entering email to receive OTP\n\n  - Entering OTP code\n\n  - Consent/approval screens\n\n  - Basic CSS styles\n\nHow to use:\n\n- Render these forms in your routes to handle user input.\n\n---\n\n1.7. Typical Auth Flow\n1. User visits login page  \n\n   \u2192 Show email input form (`renderEmailInputForm`).\n\n2. User submits email  \n\n   \u2192 Call `sendOTP` to send code to their email.  \n\n   \u2192 Show \"code sent\" screen (`renderOtpSentScreen`).\n\n3. User enters code  \n\n   \u2192 Call `verifyOTP` to check code.  \n\n   \u2192 If valid, call `storeSession` to save session in cookie.\n\n4. On each request  \n\n   \u2192 Use `getSession` and `isSessionValid` to check if user is logged in.\n\n5. User logs out  \n\n   \u2192 Call `clearSession` to remove cookie.\n\n---\n\n1.8. Example Route Pseudocode\n// Pseudocode for Hono or similar framework\n\napp.get('/login', (c) => {\n\n  return c.html(renderEmailInputForm(/* ... */));\n\n});\n\napp.post('/request-otp', async (c) => {\n\n  // Get email from form, send OTP\n\n  // Show OTP sent screen\n\n});\n\napp.post('/verify-otp', async (c) => {\n\n  // Get email and code from form\n\n  // Verify OTP\n\n  // If valid, store session\n\n  // Redirect to dashboard\n\n});\n\napp.get('/logout', (c) => {\n\n  clearSession(c);\n\n  // Redirect to login\n\n});\n---\n\n1.9 Security Tips\n- Always use HTTPS in production.\n\n- Set cookies as `httpOnly` and `secure` in production (already handled in your code).\n\n- Never expose your Supabase service key to the frontend.\n\n---\n\n1.10 Next Steps\n- Customize the UI in `auth-ui.ts` to match your branding.\n\n- Add more user fields or roles as needed.\n\n- Integrate with your main app logic.\n\n---\n\nYou now have a basic, secure email OTP authentication system using Supabase and cookies!  \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Connect OAuth\nWe will be using the cloudflare\u2019s OAuthProvider class to setup the oAuth layer;\n\nDetailed tutorial here: \n\nAuthorization\nWhen building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, you need both a way to allow users to login ...\nhttps://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/authorization/\nAuthorization\nBut basically we just need to:\n\nSetup OAuthProvider in index.ts\n\nIn app.ts, replace logic inside /authorize\n\n\n\n3. Use mcp-remote\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote\n\nWe will use mcp-remote package to setup the MCP server\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"math\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote\", \"http://localhost:4242/sse\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\nComplete lesson\nLessons\n\n\nMCP\nMCP marketplace & installation\nHow to test MCP in inspector & claude\nAwesome

Detailed Breakdown by Topic\n\n### Topic 1: ALLIGN Overview & Need\n\n* **Summary:** ALLIGN consolidates **4 disjoint apps** common in Danish construction\u2014**bidding**, **planning/tasks**, **materials & calculations**, **finance/invoicing**\u2014into one platform. Active **beta/MVP**, \\~1.5 months into serious build. Weekly iteration with a working contractor (Thomas); funded by an industry insider (\u201cOS\u201d).\n* **Decisions:** Hire a senior developer to **secure/harden** the stack and lead architecture toward production.\n* **Action items:** Provide architecture/requirements brief to candidate (Sven, 14 Aug).\n\n### Topic 2: Candidate Background & Relevance\n\n* **Summary:** Based in Lahore, Pakistan. Built **bidding**, **mortgage**, and **construction** systems. Comfortable with **Rails** (Devise/Pundit) and **Node** backends; has done **MongoDB + PostgreSQL/MySQL** mixes. Implemented **real-time telemetry** via **MQTT** and sockets; front-end shows live alerts (e.g., speed thresholds). Runs a small team (PM, QA, designer).\n* **Decisions:** Request code samples in stacks most relevant to ALLIGN.\n* **Action items:** Candidate to share repos/snippets or packaged examples (Candidate, 14 Aug).\n\n### Topic 3: Architecture, Security & Data\n\n* **Summary:** Candidate recommends **modular/microservice-ish** approach with containerization for scale and maintainability; clear separation of concerns; enable load balancing. Auth experience: **Devise/Pundit** (Rails), custom packages on Node (not yet in that MVP).\n* **Decisions:** Tech review to evaluate feasibility of modular split now vs. later, and to define **security baseline** (RBAC, row-level access, audit logs, secrets, backups).\n* **Action items:** Tech reviewer to outline architecture guardrails and security checklist (Sven \u2192 reviewer, 15 Aug).\n\n### Topic 4: UI/UX & Internationalization\n\n* **Summary:** Candidate flagged **stretched images** and non-final UI; suggested a refinement pass.

Detailed Breakdown by Topic\n\n### Topic 1: ALLIGN Overview\n\n* **Discussion:** Consolidate 4 separate construction apps (bidding, planning/tasks, materials/calculations, finance) into **one platform**. Current MVP built quickly; some modules pending; **Supabase** in use; weekly iteration with industry cofounder.\n* **Decision:** Senior engineer needed to **re-architect for production** while preserving fast iteration.\n\n### Topic 2: Candidate Background\n\n* **Discussion:** Recent AI projects; **scalability** focus; strong **AWS** exposure; comfortable with **Node.js/Next.js**; builds dashboards \u201cweekly\u201d; can ship **PWA** and **real-time** features.\n* **Decision:** Evaluate on **architecture clarity**, **code quality**, **offline-safe implementation**, and **reporting-friendly data design**.\n\n### Topic 3: Data Layer Options (MVP vs. Scale)\n\n* **Discussion:**\n\n  * **Supabase/Firebase:** Fast to ship, good real-time + queries; straightforward analytics.\n  * **DynamoDB:** **High write throughput/low latency**, but poor **ad-hoc reporting**; needs extra ETL (e.g., to Athena/Redshift/OpenSearch) for analytics.\n* **Decision:** Default to **Supabase/Firebase** for MVP; revisit DynamoDB if workload patterns demand it.\n* **Action:** Reviewer to validate expected **reporting needs** (hours per range, payroll rollups, project cost variance) and confirm DB choice.\n\n### Topic 4: Architecture Approach\n\n* **Discussion:** Candidate proposes **from-scratch refactor**: separate **API layer (Node.js)**, **frontend (Next.js)**, containerized services, enabling future **iOS/Android** without backend rewrites.\n* **Decision:** Assess feasibility of **incremental refactor** (strangle-vine) vs **full rewrite**, based on code sample review.\n\n### Topic 5: Time Tracking & PWA/Offline\n\n* **Discussion:** MVP currently web-based; candidate notes limitations of pure web timers (session loss). Recommends **PWA with offline caching**, resilient timers, and sync on reconnect.\n* **Decision:** PWA/offline is **non-negotiable** in MVP.\n* **Action:** Include **offline timer reliability**, **conflict resolution**, and **auditability** in trial task.\n\n### Topic 6: UI/UX & i18n\n\n* **Discussion:** Frontend not final; DA/EN toggle required. Candidate comfortable porting UI and refactoring components.\n* **Decision:** Trial to include **global language toggle** and one **UI clean-up** slice.\n\n### Topic 7: Commercials & Deliverables\n\n* **Discussion:** Candidate initially proposed **\\$3,000/month** (160h). Will send **fixed-price** offer for the full MVP, plus links to:\n\n  * **Real-time farmer time-tracking** app (similar problem space).\n  * Recent dashboard codebases.\n* **Decision:** Compare fixed-price proposal against internal budget/timeline.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

The platform aims to digitize workflows in what was described as one of the most conservative industries regarding productivity and efficiency. The MVP focuses on several modules including tender management, project planning, and resource management.\n\n### Platform Functionality\n\nThe platform consists of several stages that reflect a construction project's lifecycle:\n\n- **Tender Stage**: Helps companies calculate bids based on materials, time, and equipment needed\n- **Project Planning**: After winning a tender, data transfers to planning where timelines and resources are allocated\n- **Resource Management**: Assigning workers to specific tasks and tracking progress\n- **Quality Assurance**: Final stage where customers accept completed work\n\nThe system divides access between office workers (using web application) and field workers (using PWA). Field workers can see tasks, track time, and document completed work, while office workers manage the administrative aspects.\n\n### Mail Client Integration\n\nA significant discussion focused on the mail client functionality:\n\n- Mail component will be integrated throughout the platform\n- Primary use case is price negotiation for materials during tender stage\n- System will send price queries to suppliers and process responses\n- AI will be used to understand responses and update calculation sheets with negotiated prices\n- Mail blocks will be contextual to specific items within tenders\n- Goal is to increase profit margins by enabling easier price negotiations\n\n### Technical Architecture\n\n- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS\n- Database: SuperBase with RLS (Row Level Security)\n- UI Components: Using Shadcn and some components from [21st.dev](http://21st.dev)\n- Deployment: Vercel\n- Need to establish proper documentation practices\n- Automated testing needs to be implemented properly\n\n### Development Status\n\n- Currently working with a Pakistan development team\n- Development has been ongoing for about 4 months (started in March)\n- MVP is being built with weekly development updates\n- Authentication is completed\n- Time tracking functionality is being implemented\n- Need for code review to ensure quality and future scalability\n\n### AI Integration Plans\n\n- AI will help read and understand emails\n- Link responses to appropriate queries within the system\n- Assist with project planning and resource allocation\n- Help analyze project data to make more accurate estimates for future tenders\n- Summarize activities and actions taken within the system\n\n### Action Items\n\n- [ ]  Send NDA to the developer\n- [ ]  Provide GitHub and Linear access after NDA is signed\n- [ ]  Conduct code review of current repository\n- [ ]  Establish documentation practices for the project\n- [ ]  Determine which automated testing system is being used\n- [ ]  Clarify invoice handling process through Zvetomir\n- [ ]  Begin work on mail client module after code review\n\nNotes\n\nTranscript\n\nFor et tidspunkt at mindst have et samarbejdsomr\u00e5de M\u00e5ske f\u00e5r vi det Ja Okay, s\u00e5 Align er et software en multi-tenant SaaS-platform, som vi bygger for bygningsindustrien, som f\u00f8rst og fremmest targeterer SMBs, som er de... sm\u00e5re bygningskompanier i Danmark, f\u00f8rst og fremmest i Danmark, men ogs\u00e5 i Nordik. V\u00e6rdipropositionen er faktisk bare i begyndelsen. Der er forskellige sprinter.\n\nJeg mener, n\u00e5r jeg taler om en sprint, s\u00e5 er det ikke som en m\u00e6ndsklient. N\u00e5r jeg taler om sprint, s\u00e5 mener jeg i en st\u00f8rre skala. S\u00e5 vi har MVP. V\u00e6rdipropositionen i MVP er, at vi har fire, m\u00e5ske ogs\u00e5 fem forskellige software, hvor det er n\u00f8dvendigt for at g\u00f8re baggrundsforskning i Danmarks bygningsindustri.\n\nog de her moduler er ting som at have et software hvor du kan handle dine t\u00e6nders Du ved hvad et tender er, ikke? Ja. S\u00e5 er det ogs\u00e5 en kompensationstank? Med lokale regler? Sikkerhedsvis senere. Men for nu fokuserer vi mest p\u00e5... at hj\u00e6lpe projektet at komme sammen p\u00e5 budget. Normalt, i bygningsindustrien, i Danmark i hvert fald, kan jeg kun tale for Danmark, men det ville ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re s\u00e5dan i andre lande. Det er den mest konservative bransch.\n\ni forhold til produktivitet, effektivitet og udvikling, som har v\u00e6ret i de sidste 50 \u00e5r eller s\u00e5dan noget. S\u00e5 der er definitivt plads til potentiale i forhold til og digitaliseringen af branschen, nej, af industrien i t\u00e6nket p\u00e5 de softwares. S\u00e5 i t\u00e6nket p\u00e5...\n\nDer kommer til at v\u00e6re nogle ting, hvor vi har brug for tilg\u00e6ngelsekortninger, men for nu har vi fokuseret p\u00e5 t\u00e6nderne og hj\u00e6lpe dem. move along that stage quite more easily, also know what they actually asked about in the tender. So they get the documents, maybe it's...\n\n50, m\u00e5ske 100 pager p\u00e5 et project, som de vil give bid til. Men f\u00f8r de giver bid, skal de t\u00e6nke p\u00e5, hvor meget det vil tage os. hvor mange timer vi s\u00e6tter i det med vores arbejdere, ligesom 9 timer, hvor meget det materiale kommer til at koste mig. Og er der noget andet, som en daglig penalitet, hvis vi er p\u00e5 vej?\n\nP\u00e5 den anden side af deadlineen, ikke?\n\nS\u00e5 de ting vi vil have AI-agentene til at g\u00f8re, vi skal ogs\u00e5 snakke meget om det med AI-agenten, det vil hj\u00e6lpe i forskellige segmenter og forskellige deler af Align og Total. Det kan ogs\u00e5 hj\u00e6lpe med at l\u00e6se e-mail og andre ting, som er grunden til, at vi implementerer AI. Men vi skal fokusere p\u00e5 at forbedre t\u00e6nderstage, og ogs\u00e5 projekter og planstage.\n\nI s\u00e5dan en m\u00e5de, at firmaerne h\u00e6nger mere p\u00e5 budgeterne, og at budgeterne er mere realistiske og opdateret i virkeligheden, i stedet for at bare give dem en l\u00f8sning. at vi tror, at det er prisen, vi skal f\u00e5 for at f\u00e5 en profit. Hvorfor det er vigtigt for denne segment, er fordi denne segment ikke har det n\u00f8dvendige departement til at have alt det her.\n\nS\u00e5 de har ikke et specifikt t\u00e6nders\u00e6tning. N\u00e5r man g\u00e5r ind i st\u00f8rre firmaer i Danmark, s\u00e5 har de deres egen departement. For dem er det ikke s\u00e6rligt at bruge en linje som f\u00f8rste version af en linje, fordi de har deres egen departement til at tage sig af det. S\u00e5 vi fokuserer mest p\u00e5 bygninger i Danmark.\n\nsom vil v\u00e6re mellem 15-60 mennesker. N\u00e5r du er over 100, s\u00e5 har du dit eget departement.\n\nS\u00e5 det er en del af vores business teori. Men n\u00e5r vi g\u00e5r ind i softwaret, s\u00e5 har jeg og Isaac, som du m\u00f8dte f\u00f8r, vi har bygget det med Cursor. Vi har udviklet det. Vi har v\u00e6ret sammen i cirka 4 m\u00e5neder nu. Vi begyndte i marts, og s\u00e5 har vi v\u00e6ret sammen i begyndelsen.\n\nkombinerede m\u00e5neder, hvor vi bare satte hver dag og l\u00e6rte at kode, fordi vi ikke har nogen prioriteret oplevelse med at kode. Vi l\u00e6rte faktisk bare om teksten, for eksempel Next.js og React, hvad er det, og hvordan kan vi g\u00f8re det? og g\u00f8re det p\u00e5 den mest effektive m\u00e5de, hvilke pitfalls du kan tr\u00e6kke dig ind i, hvis du ikke ved, og ikke har erfaring i at g\u00f8re det.\n\nFor eksempel, hvis du ikke bruger brugsm\u00e6ssige komponenter, s\u00e5 fungerer det kun statisk i denne del af repoen, eller denne del af appen. De her ting, hvor vi f.eks. l\u00e6rte os selv, som vi udviklede en linje. S\u00e5 jeg vil vise jer repoen lidt senere. Jeg beh\u00f8ver bare at f\u00e5 Svends hj\u00e6lp, for vi har altid n\u00f8dt til at signere, at vi skal signere NDA's med hvem som helst.\n\nog f\u00e5r tilf\u00e6ldighed til repoen, selvom der er en licens og alt men jeg beh\u00f8ver bare hans hj\u00e6lp til at f\u00e5 templaten f\u00e6rdig og s\u00e5 har du tid til at l\u00e6se over alt f\u00f8r du Jeg vil gerne g\u00e5 i gang med de forskellige stager i en linje for at v\u00e6re sikker p\u00e5, at du kan se v\u00e6rten, og hvis du har nogen sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l, kan du sp\u00f8rge om det.\n\nMen det her ville v\u00e6re MVP'en. S\u00e5 n\u00e5r du er i bygningsindustrien, s\u00e5 har du f\u00f8rst og fremmest Tender Stage. Jeg talte lidt om det tidligere. I t\u00e6ndersteget, og vi har ikke det endnu, vi har ikke den specifikke funktion, men vi har udviklet pagen, vi har s\u00e6ttet op bakgrunden, ligesom databasestrukturen og alt andet, middelv\u00e6rdet.\n\nfor at passere data tilbage og foran mellem SuperBase databasen bare med en direkte forbindelse for at skabe en tender herinde som ser lidt ud til s\u00e5 du kan ikke se nogen t\u00e6nder. Lad mig pr\u00f8ve at vise dig det i et tidspunkt. Du g\u00e5r ind til en t\u00e6nder. Du skaber en t\u00e6nder. S\u00e5 har du din kalkulationskart.\n\nog s\u00e6t i alt omkring projektet. Her kalkulerer du, om du skal g\u00f8re en profit eller ikke. Du s\u00e6tter i de ressourcer, der er n\u00f8dvendige. Du s\u00e6tter i den estimeret tid. N\u00e5r du har brugt Align i 10 \u00e5r, s\u00e5 vil vi have de sidste 10 \u00e5rs data, som du havde p\u00e5\n\nat du m\u00e5ske eller m\u00e5ske ikke har vundet, men hvis du har vundet dem, s\u00e5 vil du ogs\u00e5 tracke alt fra t\u00e6nderstegen til en helt f\u00e6rdig stege, som vil kalles en kvalitetssikring, som kunderne faktisk accepterer. Ligesom n\u00e5r du er en udvikler, s\u00e5 er kunderne n\u00f8dt til at acceptere, at kriterierne, som du markerer i Linea eller Jira,\n\nGira, men det er faktisk ogs\u00e5, hvordan de vil forvente det. Det er bare i bygningsindustrien. S\u00e5 du har de sidste ti \u00e5rs organisationer. data til at bygge p\u00e5, s\u00e5 kan de sige, okay, det her projekt er ligesom den anden, vi gjorde tidligere, fordi det normalt ville v\u00e6re s\u00e5dan, og s\u00e5 er der ingen grund til, at de begynder af nyheden.\n\nS\u00e5 de kan importe s\u00e5 meget som muligt fra tidligere data, fra tidligere data, som de faktisk har tracket hele vejen rundt i systemet. S\u00e5 de kan se, at det her projekt, fordi vi bruger de her og de her materialer, og vi spilte den her og den her tid, og der var den her buffer-tid, for der er altid noget uforst\u00e5eligt i et projekt, f\u00f8r det er helt f\u00e6rdigt, og kunderne accepterer alt, som det er.\n\ni forhold til samarbejdet og s\u00e5dan noget, s\u00e5 kan du se, okay, vi havde en 3%, en 5% margin, det er normalt for dig at have en 3% margin i den bygningsindustri. Men det er s\u00e5 stort, at du faktisk g\u00f8r en stor profit. Men du spiller rundt med store m\u00e6ngder, s\u00e5 hvad vi vil hj\u00e6lpe dem med i t\u00e6nderstegen og hele tiden.\n\nsom projektplanning, ressourceplanning og andre ting. Vi vil gerne hj\u00e6lpe dem at blive mere effektive, s\u00e5 de ikke har denne forbrug, som er at ses i bygningsindustrien i dette \u00f8jeblik. S\u00e5 det er i stedet den 10. stage. En kalkulationsplade, hvor du s\u00e6tter i materialer. Jeg kan faktisk vise dig. Jeg forst\u00e5r, at det er p\u00e5 dansk, s\u00e5 det kan v\u00e6re sv\u00e6rt for dig at forst\u00e5.\n\nMen du g\u00e5r gennem denne flow, du skaber t\u00e6nderen, og s\u00e5 markerer du hele huset, vi bygger, hele 14-15 st\u00f8rre bygning, vi bygger. Det jeg er n\u00f8dt til at bidrage p\u00e5 i denne tender er kun materialerne. Det her er materialerne. Du har tre ting i en tender.\n\nDet kan v\u00e6re en kombination, s\u00e5 du har materialer, de er ressourcerne, der er brugt til at bygge et byggebygde. Du har vinduer, d\u00f8rer, alt. s\u00e5 har du tid. Tiden betyder, at hvis du ogs\u00e5 har brug for at tilf\u00f8je det til projektet, s\u00e5 er du ogs\u00e5 den, der installerer d\u00f8rene og vinduerne osv.\n\nS\u00e5 her er det ogs\u00e5 n\u00f8dvendigt at m\u00e6rke tiden, for du skal kalculere, at vi skal sp\u00e6nde 200 timer p\u00e5 at installere d\u00f8rene for et 15-storiet byggebygge. Men hvis du installerer et 15-storigt byggebygge, s\u00e5 er det n\u00f8dvendigt at have din egen byggebygge p\u00e5 toppen.\n\nHvad kalder du det? Som et vejr eller s\u00e5dan noget. Som en tool. Som en krane eller s\u00e5dan noget. Elevate crane. Okay. Ja, crane for eksempel. S\u00e5 vil du s\u00e6tte i ... for eksempel biler eller s\u00e5dan noget, ikke? Det er en dansk sprog, s\u00e5 det g\u00f8r virkelig ingen smykke i engelsk. Vi skal pr\u00e6sentere det. S\u00e5 det var de tre komponenter for Tinder.\n\nVi hj\u00e6lper dem med at have en priser\u00e6kning, der finder standardpriserne. S\u00e5 n\u00e5r du har en Excel-skrift, kan du sige, at det er en kalkulationsskrift. Den l\u00e6ser alle dokumenterne til Tinder og transferer dem til kalkuleringen og siger, hvad du beh\u00f8ver at fylde ud, er, hvor mange timer i denne del du beh\u00f8ver. Du s\u00e6tter i estimaten, men den siger,\n\nKriterierne fylder op med n\u00e6vnene af r\u00e5dene for hvad man beh\u00f8ver for at fulgere det her projekt. Er det lovligt? Ja, jeg f\u00f8lger s\u00e5 langt, det er ikke et problem Jeg tror m\u00e5ske jeg g\u00e5r lidt for langt, for vi har tre gange s\u00e5 meget at g\u00e5 S\u00e5 det ville v\u00e6re t\u00e6nderstegen. Men det er ogs\u00e5 vigtigt for mig at tale om t\u00e6nderstegen, for her vil MVP have mest af sin v\u00e6rdi. Indeni t\u00e6nderstegen, selvf\u00f8lgelig,\n\nJeg ved ikke helt, hvordan vi, selvom vi m\u00e5ske har... Lad mig tilbagetr\u00e6kke en sekund. Align vil s\u00e6lge licenser til organisationer. Organisationen vil have... De organisationer vil v\u00e6re konstruktionsfirmaer i Danmark. Vi s\u00e6lger ti licenser p\u00e5 MVP. En af licenserne er en organisation, der hedder...\n\nConstruction Company A Construction Company A would have 50 different members maybe only 20 using the PWA which is 20 bygningsarbejdere, der egentlig g\u00e5r og bygger det sted, der er n\u00f8dt til at blive bygget, i fjeldet. De vil bruge en PWA-licens, den de kan have tilknyttelse til p\u00e5 deres telefon.\n\nS\u00e5 kan de se, hvilke tasker de f\u00e5r. De kan fulgere dem. De kan time-tracke. Og de kan dokumentere, at de har gjort det job, de blev spurgt til at g\u00f8re. S\u00e5dan, at fotoen, som de tager af jobbetjentene, kan blive skrevet. Det kan blive skrevet. Det kan blive skrevet.\n\nDet kan blive skrevet. Det kan blive skrevet. Det kan blive skrevet. Det kan blive skrevet. at de har gjort, vil g\u00e5 ind i denne administrativ udsigt. N\u00e5r du er i den administrative udsigt, er du i office, i firmaet, du vil v\u00e6re lokeret i office. Og I b\u00e5de tilf\u00f8jer tiden p\u00e5 det her projekt til den her mand, der bruger PWA'en i f\u00e6ngslet? I tilf\u00f8jer tiden?\n\nS\u00e5 kan du tilf\u00f8je dokumentationen, og den er faktisk korrekt bygget. S\u00e5 vi har webbasen for computeren. og s\u00e5 har du PWA for folk i f\u00e6llesskabet, f\u00e6llesskabsl\u00e6rerne. Jeg er faktisk allerede f\u00e6rdig med alt, der er til at v\u00e6re i PWA. In the MVP at least. It's only seeing the task, tracking time on the task, this is what the Pakistan Dev House is building right now. And then there will be also documenting that you've been building.\n\nat du har fulgt din job korrekt i f\u00e6llesskabet. Det er alt for PWA i MVP-fasen. Det her er den komplekse del. Det her er webappen for de mennesker i firmaet, der sidder i officet. De beh\u00f8ver at handle det hele ved statusen, som det hedder. Tender stage, hvor du beter p\u00e5 det, du vinder et kontrakt, og s\u00e5 g\u00e5r du direkte ind i projektet og planering. Du planerer faktisk, hvorn\u00e5r du har ressourcerne interne i din organisation.\n\nfor at s\u00e6tte 200 timer ind i vindueinstallationen, ikke sagt? Du beh\u00f8ver at f\u00e5 f\u00e6rdig med dette tidspunkt, men for at v\u00e6re mest effektiv og have de her mennesker... v\u00e6re p\u00e5 arbejde hver dag, p\u00e5 den mest effektive m\u00e5de, s\u00e5 planer du det ogs\u00e5 med en AI, som hj\u00e6lper dig at planere.\n\nDet unikke ved Align er, at du lige nu har et software specifikt til at kalkulere tenderen. Hvor meget vil du bruge? for eksempel 5 millioner kroner, i ordet at lave en profit p\u00e5 det. Men nu kan vi g\u00e5, fordi vi ogs\u00e5 har projekt- og planlagtsfasen. Nu kan vi passe denne t\u00e6nder, som du faktisk har vundet, s\u00e5 kan du passe den ind i projektet. Nu kan vi begynde at planl\u00e6gge det. S\u00e5 vi kan planl\u00e6gge, at hver eneste ting, hver eneste rolle, som du har sat ind i t\u00e6nderstegen,\n\nNu er det n\u00f8dvendigt at g\u00f8re det, for alt i Tender Stage er alt, du skal g\u00f8re p\u00e5 projektet. Nu er det n\u00f8dvendigt at s\u00e6tte det ind i en timeline, og s\u00e5 s\u00e6tte det ud til f\u00e6llesskaberne, og s\u00e5 er det faktisk gjort. S\u00e5 skal vi bare s\u00f8rge for, at det er gjort korrekt efter det. S\u00e5 det er t\u00e6nderstegen, vi har v\u00e6ret p\u00e5. Den sidste del, der er vigtigt at tale om i t\u00e6nderstegen, er\n\nDet kunne v\u00e6re to typer materiale priser. Det ene er priserne, vi skal skrabe for alle... Hvad kalder vi det? M\u00e5ske bygning, retailer, markedspladser? Jeg ved ikke engelske ord til det her. Men det er her du k\u00f8ber ressourcerne, som materiale brugt i udviklingen. Her er de bygningsmaterialer, du har brug for. Lad mig finde et eksempel. For eksempel fl\u00f8jer.\n\ns\u00e5 k\u00f8ber du det. Vi vil skrabe denne pr\u00e6sse for dem, men selvf\u00f8lgelig, hvis du er 100 kvinder, s\u00e5 f\u00e5r du en bedre pr\u00e6sse, fordi du bygger massivt m\u00e5ske 10.000 m2, s\u00e5 hvis du laver en pricing-curry, som ogs\u00e5 er en del af mail-klienten, s\u00e5 vil vi \u00f8nske, at den specifikke pris for det her projekt, eller for min organisation i hvert fald, bliver den, der bliver anpasset til den del, der hedder...\n\nHvad hedder det? Du ved, kalkulationen. Vi \u00f8nsker, at de mest specifikke priser bliver anl\u00e6gget. G\u00f8r det lovligt? S\u00e5 du tager ikke standardprisen, du tager, hvad din organisation tidligere har n\u00f8gotieret med bygning, retail og markedplads? s\u00e5 ved du, at du kan f\u00e5 den her pris igen for den her tredje.\n\nDet er noget vi skal bygge ind i mailboxen, som du skal bygge. I mailboxen skal du s\u00e6tte det som en brugt komponent. Du skal kunne s\u00e6tte det overalt i en linje. Men en af de f\u00f8rste steder, hvor det er relevant, er indenfor et tender. N\u00e5r du har et tender, er det n\u00f8dvendigt at have det materiale, der har den standardpris.\n\nMen du ved, at du vil bygge mere end nogen anden projekt. Du vil bygge 10 gange s\u00e5 meget t\u00f8rre her, som du vil bygge p\u00e5 nogen anden projekt. Det er derfor, at du vil pr\u00f8ve at f\u00e5 profiter fra at n\u00f8gotiere med en bygningsret\u00e6rer. marketplace, for at f\u00e5 en bedre discountpris, fordi du kommer til at k\u00f8be en stor volym. S\u00e5 du vil n\u00f8dt til at have r\u00f8ven\n\nG\u00e5 ind i mail-blokket, s\u00e5 du kan sende en pr\u00e6sningskurier til denne firma, Stok. S\u00e5 f\u00e5r du pr\u00e6sningskurierne. specific price for this one back in a mail that goes back inside of the mailing block and would update the calculation sheet with the now more.\n\nDet er en pr\u00e6cis specifik kostning for denne specifik materiale. G\u00f8r det ikke l\u00f8gnende, fordi hvis vi forst\u00e5r det, s\u00e5 har vi n\u00e6sten alt om mailklienten. Vi er enlig i det. Det g\u00f8r ikke sikkerheden, at vi har sendt ud... S\u00e5 det er en m\u00e5de at pr\u00f8ve at optimere discountprisnegotieringer baseret p\u00e5 det, du skal have i skridtet?\n\ni specifikationerne af projektet? F\u00e5r jeg det rigtigt? Jeg fik ikke det f\u00f8rste planl\u00e6gget. Kan du forandre det? S\u00e5... Du har specifikationer for projektet. Der er materiale, som du har brug for. Vi har nogle skabt data, eller vi har nogle skabt data om, hvor meget det koster. Blandt det, de har brug for, vil de have en automatisk e-mail, sendt til firmaet,\n\nog hvis de sender tilbage, s\u00e5 er der prisen. Exakt. Hvad vi \u00f8nsker at g\u00f8re med MailClient, er bare at hj\u00e6lpe dem. Man kan manage 10-15 t\u00e6ndere pr. employee samtidig. Vi s\u00e6tter mail-komponenten indenfor denne t\u00e6nder. Fordi i denne specifikke tender vil vi lave en pricetest p\u00e5 materiale nummer 1, 2 og 3. Men i en anden tender laver vi en pricetest p\u00e5 materiale nummer 14, 15 og 16.\n\nS\u00e5 vi \u00f8nsker, at det b\u00e5de vil v\u00e6re en tidsf\u00f8rende arbejde at g\u00e5 ind i dit eget mailklient udenfor en linje, sende ud e-mailen uden et templat, Du skulle sende det ud, du skulle se i din e-mail og finde den, der er linket til den tidligere besked, som prisen. Du skulle g\u00e5 tilbage indenfor en linje.\n\neller hvilken software, du k\u00f8rer, og s\u00e5 l\u00e6gge det til t\u00e6nderen, du lavede denne project-kurse p\u00e5. G\u00f8r det ikke l\u00f8gnet? S\u00e5 der er s\u00e5 mange gange, at du kan forlade linken mellem dem. S\u00e5 hvad vi vil g\u00f8re, er at have mailbugget direkte indenfor Tinder. Og du tager...\n\nDu tager det data, som du allerede har s\u00e6ttet ind i tenderkalkulationen, ind i mailbloget. Du laver en pricing-karriere p\u00e5 det. Det bliver sendt gennem mailklienten, som vi ogs\u00e5 bygger indenfor en linje. Og det er bare en mail, der bliver sendt. S\u00e5, n\u00e5r du f\u00e5r en reply, kan det g\u00e5 en af to m\u00e5der. Det kan enten blive replyet direkte tilbage i denne e-mail-kreds. Det er perfekt, for s\u00e5 ved vi, at den er blevet linket.\n\nfra denne pr\u00e6dikation om materiale nummer 5 og replikationen er en replikation til materiale nummer 5 for denne m\u00e5ned, ikke sant? Men hvad kan ogs\u00e5 ske, det er den ene scenarie s\u00e5 er det meget, meget let at f\u00e5, i hvert fald det er mere let at f\u00e5 data fra mailbokken, direkte tilbage til kalkulationen. Rigtigt?\n\nS\u00e5 du sender priserne ud i mailboxen til et sted, m\u00e5ske ogs\u00e5 til en konkurrerende firma. Du f\u00e5r en god priser tilbage, og du s\u00e6tter det i din kvalifikationsplade. Nu ved du exakt, at det her skal v\u00e6re din priser for dette materiale. Nu ved vi, at vi bare har \u00f8kstret profitmarginen p\u00e5 hele projektet med 1%, fordi vi er i stand til at handle det nu. F\u00f8r har vi ikke v\u00e6ret i stand til at g\u00f8re det, fordi det ville v\u00e6re...\n\nDu er for distraheret af mange andre arbejder, som du ogs\u00e5 skal g\u00f8re. S\u00e5 du kan ikke have din hovedstolpe p\u00e5 priserne for de sm\u00e5... sommer af penge, at en materiale er. En materiale, du kan m\u00e5ske kun, lad os sige kun, og det er i danske penge, s\u00e5 det ville klare sig mere...\n\nDet er ikke meget i totalsummen af projektet, men m\u00e5ske kan du redde 20.000 kroner. Det er 4.000 p\u00e5 bulgarisk niveau. 5.000 p\u00e5 bulgarisk niveau. Men n\u00e5r du s\u00e6tter det p\u00e5 toppen, s\u00e5 er det en masse penge, for nu kan du lave en pr\u00e6ssekurve af det her, og det her, og det her. Du har 10 materialer indenfor 1 t\u00e6nder.\n\nOg nu kan du bevare 200.000 kroner. Lad os kigge.\n\nS\u00e5 det er en m\u00e5de at f\u00e5 tilbage reaktionen. Den anden m\u00e5de er, at du f\u00e5r en ny mail tilbage fra stocket, der er helt uafh\u00e6ngig. Det er ikke i den samme mail. Men han vil gerne, at mailklienten skal have AI'en at g\u00e5 igennem alle nye e-mail, som du f\u00e5r og pr\u00f8ve at se, om der er nogen link, vi skal linke til. Hvis der er, s\u00e5 har vi en submodel indenfor mailklienten\n\nDet er kaldt, lad os kalde det tilf\u00f8lgelse, s\u00e5 AI har konsumteret de nye e-mail og det har Jeg t\u00e6nkte, at jeg troede, at dette materiale ville v\u00e6re det samme som brugt p\u00e5 Tender nr. 37. Ogs\u00e5 fordi jeg kan se, at der er en aktiv pr\u00e6sningskarriere p\u00e5. t\u00e6nder nummer 37, og jeg kan se, at det er dette materiale. Det var ikke speciferet i denne reply tilbage i en anden mail fra stock, men jeg tror, at det skulle v\u00e6re dette.\n\nlink, right? So when you go back as a, yeah, obviously just tell me if you need to take, need some time to take notes, okay? Er det for komplekteret? Jeg kan lave en mere holistisk udsigt. Nej, jeg f\u00f8lger s\u00e5 langt. Det giver en masse information. Men jeg vil gerne bare g\u00e5 igennem det, indtil du forst\u00e5r melkelinen, og hvorfor det er v\u00e6rt for melkelinen. Og s\u00e5 n\u00e5r vi begynder at arbejde sammen, s\u00e5 begynder du at se, og n\u00e5r vi har m\u00f8der, s\u00e5 siger jeg til dig, at denne modul er til det her.\n\nog blablabla, s\u00e5 vil hele billedet begynde at komme sammen, ikke? For der er forskellige deler, som vi vil pr\u00f8ve at revolutionere p\u00e5 den m\u00e5de, de software er bygget p\u00e5 nu. Den f\u00f8rste ting er, at MVP-scoren bare parser data fra en stage af projektet til den anden. S\u00e5 fra tender til projektet har du ikke nogen...\n\nsoftware kurrentt, der kan passe data, s\u00e5 her har vi allerede v\u00e6rtskab. Hvad vi pr\u00f8ver at g\u00f8re nu, er at hj\u00e6lpe dem indenfor Tinder-specifikke moduler. i kalkulationen, f\u00e5r de mest relevante og bedst n\u00f8dvendige priser p\u00e5 hvilket materiale, for at \u00f8ge deres profitmarginale.\n\nDen eneste m\u00e5de vi kan g\u00f8re det muligt er at overv\u00e6lge det AI-agent vi skal bygge indenfor en linje. helt g\u00f8r jobbet af at l\u00e6nke prisen til mail responsen s\u00e5 hvis det er i en ny mail s\u00e5 f\u00e5r du tilbage denne prisen s\u00e5 det ikke er i samme mail thread s\u00e5 g\u00e5r det ind i mailkontrolleringsmodulet. N\u00e5r du ser tilbage p\u00e5 en linje, s\u00e5 ser du, at AI-agenten i nattetiden er g\u00e5et gennem de nye mail.\n\nog det er set, at der m\u00e5ske er en link mellem det her. Nu er jeg n\u00f8dt til at l\u00e6se det, og s\u00e5 vil jeg afpr\u00f8ve det. Hvis det bliver afpr\u00f8vet, eller n\u00e5r det bliver afpr\u00f8vet, at det her var den rigtige link. N\u00e5r du \u00e5bner t\u00e6nderne igen, hvor du har afpr\u00f8vet linken mellem, s\u00e5 ser du mailblog. I mailbloget er det n\u00f8dvendigt at...\n\nLad mig bare begynde. I mailbloget kan du se i tidligere aktiviteter, at du har sendt ud prisen. Men nu er statusen forandret. Du har bestemt, at priserne har blevet ansvaret, og nu har du prisen for dette materiale.\n\nOg fordi du har tilf\u00f8jt, at denne mail er linket til denne materiale i denne tender, den har nu en link til en linje, s\u00e5 vil vi have, at denne mail at v\u00e6re inde i mailbloget. Det er den nyeste aktivitet nu. S\u00e5 du har en aktivitet, der hedder, du sender ud prisen og en aktivitet, der hedder, du f\u00e5r en replik. At f\u00e5 en replik og at linke det, er en job for EA-agenten.\n\nEllers er det ikke muligt.\n\nDet er det mest vigtigste ved m\u00e6lken. Resten af m\u00e6lken er bare standardudvikling. Det her er noget nyt og innovativt. Og lad os se om det er muligt. Jeg tror, at det er muligt, fordi AI-agenten er mulig. Linket og at l\u00e6se e-mailerne b\u00f8r v\u00e6re muligt. S\u00e5 er der GDPR-regler, men...\n\nMen lad os tage det senere. Jeg forlod de sidste par ord. Jeg tror ikke, vi har en konnektion. G\u00e5ende gennem og forst\u00e5ende af e-mailerne b\u00f8r v\u00e6re muligt for hvilken AI-agent. Men at l\u00e6nge det til en pr\u00e6sningskurier, som du har lavet indenfor en mailbag og en tender.\n\nEr det l\u00f8gnet? Vi er indenfor en mailblog, en tender. I denne mailblog har du skrevet priserne for hvilken materiale der er inde i mailbloget. kalkulation sheet for it to be linked to this new email reply in a new mail it would need to have the context on every single mail blog and every single pricing query in every single tender\n\nS\u00e5 det er det, vi skal give denne EA-agent. Bare den EA-agent, der blinker. Du kan splitte den EA-agent. Eller den EA-agent kan g\u00f8re hver eneste... AI-job, der er n\u00f8dt til at g\u00f8res, eller vi kan kalde denne AI-agent, vi kan kalde det mailblog til pricenquery fra mailklient.\n\nS\u00e5 hvis jeg f\u00e5r det rigtigt, s\u00e5 pr\u00f8ver du at have en rejsegregation af alle materialer, baseret p\u00e5 alle projekter, som f\u00e5r information fra e-mail. Ja, men mailblogget skulle ikke kun v\u00e6re \u00e9n mailblog i Tinder. Det skulle v\u00e6re en pop-out, for det ville v\u00e6re for... Okay, det er om fundering, s\u00e5 det betyder ingenting.\n\nDet vil v\u00e6re en mail blok, som du aktiverer p\u00e5 hver eneste r\u00e6kke. S\u00e5 hvis du v\u00e6lger, at du accepterer at bruge de standard priser, for disse materialer. Du har 10 materialer i kalkulationen, og vi kommer til at bidrage p\u00e5 denne tender. F\u00f8r vi bidrager p\u00e5 tenderen, vil vi s\u00f8rge for, at de priserne er korrekte. Tre af de materialer har du aldrig arbejdet med f\u00f8r, s\u00e5 nu skal du\n\nat f\u00e5 priserne og det gennem en priskurs som du skal g\u00f8re indenfor dig det vil kun v\u00e6re indenfor mailbloget Apart if it goes like the other scenario where it's not being responded in the mail thread, it's going to be a new mail that comes back. Then you also need to go and approve it before it's linked back to the mail block.\n\nMen andre steder vil alle dine arbejder p\u00e5 denne pr\u00e6sentation v\u00e6re inden for mailblog og Tinder.\n\nMen hvis der er tre materialer ud af ti, som du aldrig har arbejdet med f\u00f8r og du ikke ved prisen, s\u00e5 vil vi jo s\u00f8rge for, at vi ikke forlader pengene i dette projekt, fordi vi ikke var sikre om den anden materialspris. S\u00e5 vi skal lave en mailplug med i kontekst af denne materiale, som har en aktivitet, der hedder Pris & Currency Sent, Pris & Currency Received.\n\nPriseret. Nu er dette materiale godt. Det er helt f\u00e6rdigt. Vi kan nu sende tilbage bit Vi kan sige, at dette vil v\u00e6re prisen, og vi kan sende tilbage biddet bare for dette materiale. Det n\u00e6ste materiale er n\u00f8dvendigt at v\u00e6re en anden, helt frisk, med ingen aktiviteter inde i mailplug, hvor man nu kan lave en ny priser\u00e6kning.\n\nDu skal ogs\u00e5 kunne g\u00f8re det i parallelt, s\u00e5 du kan have tre forskellige mailblogs. Og hver eneste mailblog handler omkring \u00e9n priser. for en materiale i kalkulationen.\n\nGodt. Okay, jeg forst\u00e5r det. Jeg spurgte, hvad det var med mailbloggen sidste gang, og nu ved jeg det. Ja, mailbloggen er... Ja, det er faktisk en notepad. Det er et tekst, jeg lavede, men med integrationer til den m\u00e6ndsl\u00e6gen og at processere det. Og AI-agenten, jeg ved ikke meget om AI. Ligesom de tekniske ting, det tekst bag det. Men AI-agenten b\u00f8r kunne... Vi kan bare g\u00f8re det en \u00e5ben AI API-klokke.\n\ns\u00e5 vi ikke beh\u00f8ver at t\u00e6nke p\u00e5 noget. Vi kan bare lave en assistent i OpenAI's playground. S\u00e5 kan vi se, om det kan g\u00e5 og snakke med en mailblog. Inside of a tender, inside of a line. If it can do that, then we are in a good spot, because then we can work on the back-end for the AI agent later on. Then we can improve it and give it context on, okay.\n\nen materiale pricing query templat skal se ud som denne. S\u00e5 hver gang en bruger g\u00e5r til mailblog og siger nu vil jeg lave en pricing query for dette materiale, for dette volym, s\u00e5 vil jeg f\u00f8lge dette templat, men det her er helt anderledes, det er et andet sted, vi har t\u00e6nkt os at bygge dette, det giver kun kontekst\n\ntil EA-agenten. S\u00e5 mit forslag er, at vi har mange forskellige arbejder for EA-agenten. til brugeren vil det v\u00e6re \u00e9n AR-agent. Men baggrunden, vi beh\u00f8ver at fjerne forskellige kontekster og vi vil sikre, at AR-agenten, der handler med at l\u00e6ngere mellem\n\nen mailblog og en mail har det specifikke content\n\nMen et andet arbejde for en AI-agent vil v\u00e6re at skabe en template specifikt til denne materiale, denne volum, til denne specifikke... Det er noget andet. Det er et andet kontekst.\n\nJeg tror det er alt jeg beh\u00f8ver at sige, for ellers vil jeg bare g\u00f8re det mere komplekert end det er n\u00f8dvendigt. Jeg vil bare sp\u00f8rge et par ting. The AI agent, when you say it wants to go to like a specific mail block or to a specific tender, what exactly do you mean? How do you plan to do this?\n\nJeg vil bare gerne f\u00e5 det. Lad mig forst\u00e5. Hvad forst\u00e5r jeg fra din sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l? Anderledes vil jeg ikke udtale noget, der ikke er din sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l. Jeg forst\u00e5r, at du mener, Hvordan ville vi gerne have, at EA-agenten kunne forst\u00e5 20 forskellige t\u00e6ndere og prisen stiger. Kan du opleve din sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l? Jeg er ikke helt sikker p\u00e5, at jeg svarer. Min sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l er...\n\nHvordan planl\u00e6gger du at tilf\u00f8je den her information til AI-agenten? Vi skulle aktivere en aktivitet indenfor en mail-blog. som en pricing query, n\u00e5r den er blevet givet statusen af en aktiv pricing query. S\u00e5 du beh\u00f8ver ikke at f\u00e5 kontekst p\u00e5 hver enkelt mailblog, der er aktiv, for nogle af dem kan bare v\u00e6re en notepad.\n\nfor fremtidige pricing kreder, som vi skal g\u00f8re, men du har ikke sendt den ud endnu. S\u00e5 for at linke pricing krederet i en mailplug indenfor en tender, til de nye m\u00e6nd af mailklienterne en af de nye m\u00e6nd kan v\u00e6re sammenlignet med denne pr\u00e6sentation eller faktisk er det\n\nHvis det har statusen af sendt ud, s\u00e5 m\u00e5 vi t\u00e6nke p\u00e5 de her pricing kursus. Vi beh\u00f8ver ikke at t\u00e6nke p\u00e5 pricing kursus, der er afgjort. Eller de, der ikke er sendt ud endnu. S\u00e5 en mail skulle ikke bruges, hvis det allerede er gjort. Hvis arbejdet er gjort, og priserne er forbedret ...\n\nThen there is no more context for PriceyCruise2Males, this link.\n\nOkay. Det er ikke en let arbejde. Jeg er ogs\u00e5 interesseret i at forst\u00e5, i en holistisk udsigt, hvordan det tekniske arbejde skulle fungere. Jeg tror, det er muligt. Jeg pr\u00f8ver at t\u00e6nke p\u00e5, hvordan det kommer til at fungere. Det er muligt. Det afh\u00e6nger virkelig af, hvordan du passer hele dataet. Jeg t\u00e6nker p\u00e5, at du har e-mailen, du har alt, men i slutningen af dagen er det bare en linje af tekst eller en linje af rekord.\n\nS\u00e5 du sagde, at du bruger Firebase, rigtigt? Vi har pr\u00f8vet det i en tid, men vi bruger SuperBase. Okay, godt. Er det okay?\n\nJeg kommer tilbage til dig senere. Det h\u00e6nger p\u00e5, hvilke brugsm\u00e5l der er. En af grunderne er, at du ikke vil g\u00e5 dybt ind i Firebase. Det er derfor, at The Base kom ud, var, at de endelig lukkede det i, og de steg bare prisen op og op og op. Det er s\u00e5dan et vertikalt sk\u00e6ring, hvor det bliver alvorligt kostn\u00e6gtigt.\n\nDet er ogs\u00e5 noget jeg har h\u00f8rt. Det afh\u00e6nger virkelig af, hvordan vi skal forhandle det her.\n\nYeah. Figure out the cheapest and most robust option. So what I'm trying to say is that if you have all this data, if you get it, then you put it... properly organized into a database. It's much more easier once you know what you're doing to create a process where you can just feed it to whatever AI or agent you have.\n\nFor den m\u00e5de du forklarer det til mig, hvis vi pr\u00f8ver at g\u00f8re det s\u00e5dan her, s\u00e5 vil vi bare overkomplicere det. Men hvis vi bare holdt dataet ligesom h\u00f8jt og lille. Vi kan faktisk opn\u00e5 meget af det, du siger, og vi beh\u00f8ver ikke at bruge AI-agenter for alt, faktisk.\n\nMen du b\u00f8r bruge en AI-agent til at, jeg mener, jeg ved ikke, hvordan det skulle g\u00f8res, men metafyldning eller s\u00e5dan noget, for at forst\u00e5 pricenqueryet, og hvad... Du kan sammenl\u00e6gge det til \u00e9n materiale, og du kan tagge, hvilken e-mail den er blevet sendt til. Probabiliteten, at det kommer tilbage fra e-mailadressen, er meget stor.\n\nSelv indenfor den samme mail-threat. Jeg mener, at 90% af tiden skal det bare komme tilbage indenfor den samme mail-threat. Og s\u00e5 kan vi bare vise det indenfor mail-bloget. Det vil ikke v\u00e6re et problem. Men for resten af tiden, og det er ogs\u00e5 fordi det er noget vi vil g\u00f8re kontinuerligt, ogs\u00e5 hvis det ikke er en pricing-kurve.\n\nMailblog er kommunikation ind i og ud af en linje. Det kan v\u00e6re en pricing-kreder, der skal kommunikeres. Det kan v\u00e6re en kunder, du skal kommunikere med p\u00e5 et specifikt projekt. p\u00e5 en tegning, som du har. Er dette en tegning af, hvordan vi b\u00f8r g\u00f8re arbejdet? Ogs\u00e5 opdateret, er det den rette?\n\nS\u00e5 bruger du mailbloggen til at sende det ud og sp\u00f8rge om denne sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l. Og vi \u00f8nsker at pr\u00f8ve at komme tilbage til mailbloggen. Her har vi en mailblogg, der har priserne. og en, der beh\u00f8ver at have brugskassen af en mail til kunden, der beh\u00f8ver at bevise, at noget er gjort korrekt. Her er tanken, at...\n\nfor at forst\u00e5 det, og s\u00e5 forslaget i acceptance eller tilf\u00f8jelse af det submodul, der hedder tilf\u00f8jelse. For vi \u00f8nsker ikke, at mail er linket til en mailblog, der ikke er korrekt. Men hvis brugeren tilf\u00f8jer, at det skal v\u00e6re en... Det er det, AI-agenten forst\u00e5r, at der skal v\u00e6re en link mellem. Er du med om det? Er du med om denne link? Jeg er med om det. Okay, s\u00e5 er der ingen problem. S\u00e5 er det op til dig ogs\u00e5.\n\nEr det afgjort eller ikke? Hvis det er afgjort, s\u00e5 har vi en ting, der hedder priser\u00f8velsen. Nu har vi en respons p\u00e5 priser\u00f8velsen. Det her er en slags link. En anden vil v\u00e6re en mail blok, der vi placerer, fordi det er en tilbrugelig komponent, vi placerer det ogs\u00e5 inden for projekterne, og her har vi\n\nmail, der er til kunderne, en mail-kreds, der hedder, eller en mail, der bliver sendt ud, der hedder, er det her? Skal vi g\u00f8re det korrekt, hvis vi f\u00f8lger dine instruktioner? Ligesom denne, denne og denne? Og s\u00e5 skriver kunderne tilbage, men han skriver tilbage i en anden mail-kreds.\n\nVi \u00f8nsker ogs\u00e5, at det g\u00e5r tilbage til Mabler.\n\nKan vi bare g\u00e5 over det igen? Ja, selvf\u00f8lgelig. Jeg mener bare, at linket mellem en mailblog og en mailblog er bare text-edit\u00f8ren, som du talte om i g\u00e5r. for m\u00e6ndklienten. Det er bare komprimeret til kun de relevante m\u00e6nd, s\u00e5 du ikke har hele spannen, du har ikke hele lydet.\n\nDu har bare de relevante mailer for denne pr\u00e6sningskurve. Du kan ogs\u00e5 sammenligne det, s\u00e5 du kun f\u00e5r den specifikke, korrekte ansvar. Fordi du er ikke... If the guy from Stark writes that you can also get this and this and this product in the mail, but you are only interested in this, then we can summarize it for you.\n\nog vi kan hj\u00e6lpe dig med at s\u00e6tte den opdaterede priser for hvilken volym du har spurgt for Vi er n\u00f8dt til at have en AI-agent at forst\u00e5 det og s\u00e5 s\u00e6tte i volymen i volymfieldet, s\u00e6tter i hvor meget volym det er, m\u00e5ske er det 25 m2, men ogs\u00e5 prisen pr. m2 og i totalt.\n\nOkay, so the summary on the email and just extracting volume prices and other relevant data, if there are some. Ja, vi \u00f8nsker at k\u00f8benheden i arbejdet er s\u00e5 meget i h\u00e5nden, at han kun l\u00e6ser det. Og det beviser det. Okay, ja, det her er linken. Okay, ja, du forstod korrekt, at det her var voldet, og at det her var prisen, der blev sendt tilbage som en replik for prisen.\n\nFrom stock, on this project, a product that I've been asking on. So now you may put it inside of the calculation sheet and update this row. til det materiale.\n\nOkay.\n\nOg s\u00e5? Men det er bare pricen. Ja. Den anden mailbug-brugskase kan v\u00e6re... mail bliver sendt ud, men replikationen beh\u00f8ver ikke n\u00f8dvendigvis at bruges til at s\u00e6tte ind i en kalkulationsplade. Det eneste med price increase er, at du pr\u00f8ver at opdatere data for din kalkulationsplade. Og du sender en e-mail og f\u00e5r tilbage en respons.\n\nAI will understand the mail thread, because it basically has all of the context inside of the mailbox. So you can activate another AI agent workflow. Det hedder kun, at forst\u00e5 min behov, forst\u00e5 hans respons. N\u00e5r du har gjort det, forst\u00e5r du, hvordan du skal forvandle r\u00f8ven. Du forst\u00e5r, hvordan du skal forvandle omr\u00e5det.\n\nFordi hvis min priser\u00f8velsebefaling ikke er forst\u00e5elig til en AI-agent. Det er ikke forst\u00e5eligt til den gange i stedet. Men hvis det er det, og du kan replikere, s\u00e5 b\u00f8r en AI-agent ogs\u00e5 kunne forst\u00e5 det og update r\u00f8ven. Det er en anden ting vi kan bygge p\u00e5, men den anden ting er bare at l\u00e6nge generelle m\u00e6nd p\u00e5 hver anden arbejde. Jeg kan give dig nogle eksempler, jeg kan skrive det i Slack.\n\nJeg kan skrive tre helt forskellige eksempel p\u00e5 de forskellige m\u00e5der vi \u00f8nsker, at mail-bloget skal linke til forskellige mail. indenfor mail-indpakken, men det er meget let for en AI-agent, der opretter kun indenfor nye mail i mail-klienten. N\u00e5r jeg taler om mail-klienten, taler jeg om, at her har du din indpakke.\n\nDu kan sende og f\u00e5 mail i mailklienten, som i alle andre mailklienter, som Outlook. Det ser helt ud som Outlook, eller hvad vi kan t\u00e6nke os, i termer af frontend, right? Men det her er bare en m\u00e6lklient. Men vi \u00f8nsker at have en m\u00e6lklient, en brugt komponent, som kan blive s\u00e6ttet i forskellige deler af en linje.\n\nog snakke med mail-klienten. I mail-klienten har vi en AI, der g\u00e5r igennem og forst\u00e5r nye mail, der kommer ind. Vi har en AI, der g\u00e5r igennem... hver aktion, som en brugere g\u00f8r indenfor en linje. T\u00e6nk p\u00e5 det som, at vi kunne lave en log af hver eneste aktion, der er taget p\u00e5 en brugere indenfor en linje.\n\nOg i denne vlog kommer vi til at sammenl\u00e6gge, hvad det er, der har v\u00e6ret taget her. Hvis det er en pr\u00e6sningskurier, s\u00e5 sammenl\u00e6gger vi det, og s\u00e5 denne del med sammenl\u00e6ggelsen. af en AI-agent, som kun arbejder indenfor loggen, sammenfatter og laver, lad os sige, bare som et eksempel, det beh\u00f8ver at skrive\n\nexakt 100 ord p\u00e5 hver enkelt aktion taget indenfor en linje. S\u00e5 skal disse 100 ord blive linket mellem denne log og denne nye. mail, som du har i din mailbokse, og dette er en manuel, dette er en menneske i l\u00f8bet af tilf\u00e6ldighed. Hvad er tilf\u00e6ldig? Det ved, at locket, som er blevet linket til nu, ogs\u00e5 er en m\u00e5de at g\u00f8re det. Forstod du det? Eller er det en meget...\n\nNej, nej, nej. Jeg f\u00f8lger s\u00e5 l\u00e6nge. Det er en masse ting. Det er fordi vi vil pr\u00f8ve at g\u00f8re mail-drukken...\n\nFordi det er kommunikation ind i og ud af en linje, vil vi gerne have hver eneste aktion Det er ikke muligt at blive kommuniceret udenfor en linje i en linje. Og den replik, du f\u00e5r tilbage, b\u00f8r g\u00e5 direkte ind i mailbloget. S\u00e5 jeg har givet jer et eksempel, hvor jeg har g\u00e5et i d\u00e6mt. Det var kun pricencurry, men der kan v\u00e6re mange andre eksempeler. Hvis vi laver en lock p\u00e5 hver eneste aktion, som en bruger,\n\nDe kan ikke lave en task indenfor en linje, uden at det bliver lagt. Hvis lagtet f\u00e5r en sammenligning af en AI-agent, der forst\u00e5r, i kontekstet af exakt hvad du g\u00f8r, og denne AI-agent opererer kun i modulen, der hedder for eksempel projektplanering, stage. S\u00e5 det begynder at...\n\nat f\u00e5 nyheder om, at n\u00e5r du deplojerer et arbejde her og her, s\u00e5 betyder det, at du skal arbejde mere p\u00e5 denne parti, som du tilf\u00f8jer dem til og det vil betyde, at forandringen skal... Jeg mener, det er dumme eksempler, som jeg giver dig for det er s\u00e5 komplekt.\n\nJa, jeg begyndte at arbejde, men det er store eksempler, jeg giver dig, for det er sv\u00e6rt at forst\u00e5, hvis vi ikke har snakket om dette modul endnu. Jeg tror, det er allerede godt, at du forst\u00e5r meldblokken for pr\u00e6sse og karriere.\n\nJeg tror ogs\u00e5, at mailblogget er en n\u00e6ste stage ting, og vi havde multiple m\u00f8der mellem nu. Og n\u00e5r du begynder p\u00e5 mailblogget, fordi for at g\u00f8re mailblogget, skal du have sat op hele mail-klienten, som om det ser ud som Outlook. Ja, for du kan ikke lave en mailblog uden at den bliver integreret til organisationerne eller brugernes mailblogs. Mailklient. Lad os kalde det mailklient.\n\nS\u00e5 hvad skal vi begynde at arbejde p\u00e5 nu? Det vi \u00f8nsker at g\u00f8re f\u00f8rst og fremmest, Det er CodeReview, s\u00e5 du forst\u00e5r, hvad der nu er bygget, og hvad der er bygget p\u00e5. Ogs\u00e5 af min deltagelse i linjeren af, hvad der er bygget p\u00e5. skope af MVP, der har v\u00e6ret sendt til Pakistan, at de vil f\u00e6rdige i 8 uger. De har v\u00e6ret byggende i 4 uger, og de vil bygge i 8 uger mere.\n\nOg faktisk i totalt er det 13 uger, s\u00e5 m\u00e5ske 9 uger mere. I 9 uger mere er de helt f\u00e6rdige med hver eneste problem, du ser indenfor Linea. Jeg vil deltage i dette. Jeg vil ogs\u00e5 deltage i GitHub repo. S\u00e5 du kan se, hvor langt de er n\u00e5et lige nu. Og du kan \u00e5bne det i localhost, og du kan se det foran. Du kan g\u00e5 gennem de forskellige moduler. Du kan se, okay, det de har v\u00e6ret byggende p\u00e5, det er den autentikation.\n\nOg det er faktisk det, ogs\u00e5 timeregistrationen indenfor PWA, der bliver sendt til Den computerversion af en linje, hvor den computerversion af en linje... Lad mig vise dig en ting, hvis vi lukker herud. Nu er vi besat. Hvis jeg s\u00e6tter min e-mail adresse, og jeg pr\u00f8ver at logge ind, s\u00e5 vil det p\u00e5 bakgrunden forst\u00e5,\n\nHar han f\u00e5et et administrativt rolle, eller har han f\u00e5et et f\u00e6rdigt rolle? Det er en af to ting. Ingenting mere end de to er muligt. Hvis det er administrativ rolle, s\u00e5 bliver jeg s\u00e6ttet her. For det er alt, jeg er n\u00f8dt til at se som administrativ. Der er ingen grund til, at jeg kan se, hvad der sker i PWA.\n\nDe har kun brug for at have arbejdernes data, som en timeregistration, p\u00e5 hver projekt. De har placeret fem timer og dokumenteret deres arbejde til i dag. I PWA, p\u00e5 dette projekt, de sendte det ind til min opm\u00e6rksomhed her. Jeg er administrat\u00f8ren, og jeg er n\u00f8dt til at afpr\u00f8ve, at de har s\u00e6ttet tidene korrekt. De har ikke k\u00f8bt eller noget.\n\nog dokumentationen er korrekt, f\u00f8lgende regler for dokumentationen, s\u00e5 vi har administrativt udsigt, det er det, du ser her, og s\u00e5 har du PWA. Og det ville v\u00e6re sv\u00e6rt for mig at vise jer, fordi jeg ikke kender nogen user jeg kan autentikere med. der har PWA-kontakt, men du kan pr\u00f8ve at lave en, n\u00e5r du er her.\n\nS\u00e5 jeg tror, at det vi kommer til at starte at bygge p\u00e5, er det koreview for repoen af det de har bygget i Pakistan. Og du beh\u00f8ver at linke det til, hvad de faktisk har lavet i bygningen, og hvilke tasker vi har givet dem indenfor Linea. Og du kan bare kigge p\u00e5 Linea. Lad mig bare finde Linea.\n\nFor eksempel for denne uge, der g\u00f8r timetracking p\u00e5 komponenterne. Ligesom tiden kan begynde og stoppe alt, ikke? S\u00e5 forst\u00e5, hvad vi har fortalt dem, og hvad de siger, at de har bygget. er det faktisk ogs\u00e5 s\u00e5 godt kode, som vi \u00f8nsker det at v\u00e6re. Vi \u00f8nsker ikke at v\u00e6re... Jeg ved ikke meget om koding, men vi \u00f8nsker ikke, at det bliver noget, der...\n\nDet er sv\u00e6rt at holde, og vi \u00f8nsker ikke, at det er noget, der kun er muligt i denne statiske tilf\u00e6lde. bruger i denne brugsfase. Vi \u00f8nsker at kunne integrere tidsregistrering med en AI-agent senere. Men \u00e6rligvis, hvis det ikke g\u00e6lder, hvad jeg siger lige nu, s\u00e5 fort\u00e6l mig, for jeg ved ikke s\u00e5 meget om det. Det betyder, at du \u00f8nsker at sikre skalabilitet i fremtiden.\n\nSystem integration, forward system integration. Yes. Is that like the proper terms? Definitely. Yeah, I understand. I'm so happy that you repeated it back like that. That makes it, that means that. Jeg kommunikerede det bare rundt godt nok. Det er fint. Det er godt mand, du beh\u00f8ver ikke at vr\u00e6nge dig. Jeg f\u00e5r det, det er bare en masse ting. Det er en masse ting.\n\nDet er et helt nyt projekt for mig. Selvf\u00f8lgelig, selvf\u00f8lgelig, selvf\u00f8lgelig. N\u00e5r du begynder at forst\u00e5 det, og n\u00e5r vi begynder at arbejde sammen p\u00e5 det, s\u00e5 vil det v\u00e6re... Det er et stort software. Vi har penge for en lang rundvej, s\u00e5 l\u00e6nge vi f\u00e5r noget for penge. Hvis det g\u00e6lder. Vi f\u00e5r den penge, den er v\u00e6rd.\n\nJeg mener, hvis du g\u00f8r det f\u00f8rst, og du reagerer tilbage med Det er noget for os at forst\u00e5, om det her kode er godt eller d\u00e5rligt, og om det er det, vi \u00f8nsker, og om det ogs\u00e5 er det, vi sp\u00f8rger dem om at g\u00f8re i Linea. Er det ikke muligt at have et fremtidigt\n\nSkalabilitet i termer af integrationer, som du bare sagde, som du bare n\u00e6vnte, er det muligt eller ikke med denne specifikke kode, ikke? Med denne specifikke kode, som de har gjort for det her. Jeg er sikker p\u00e5, at du bare h\u00f8rer p\u00e5 GitHub. Bare f\u00f8r jeg s\u00e6tter access, ved jeg, at jeg beh\u00f8ver at have NDA-signalen. Det er alt det, Svend \u00f8nsker.\n\nFor eksempel har de lavet branchen til uge 1 udvikling, s\u00e5 det er ganske let for en nykommer at forst\u00e5. Uge 1 vil ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re uge 1 i Linea. Lige nu er jeg ikke sikker p\u00e5, hvor uge 1 er. Det er her. Often er rollebaseret autentikation. Jeg husker ikke, hvad C st\u00e5r for, men er det ogs\u00e5 det, de har bygget i denne branche? Du kan se p\u00e5 aktiviteten, eller hvad det er. Jeg ved ikke, hvordan man bruger GitHub s\u00e5 effektivt som du.\n\nJa, men det var det, vi \u00f8nskede. Det var det f\u00f8rste, vi \u00f8nskede. At g\u00e5 igennem det, de har v\u00e6ret tr\u00e6t af. Hvad de har bygget, er de bygget et godt kode, afh\u00e6ngig af vores forh\u00e5nd, og afh\u00e6ngig af, hvad vi pr\u00f8ver at f\u00e5 dem til at g\u00f8re i forhold til Linea?\n\nEr de bygget det? Og hvad, og hvis ikke, eller hvis du har noget i minde, som ikke er, hvordan du vil bygge det. S\u00e5 hvad er det, i form for hvad du forst\u00e5r fra det jeg har talt om, om en linje i form for integreringer med m\u00e6nd, i form for integreringer med AI?\n\ner der nogen begr\u00e6nsning til det her, i forhold til hvilken kode de har bygget? Eller kunne det v\u00e6re muligt? Kunne det v\u00e6re muligt at g\u00f8re alle de integrationer vi har talt om? og hver enkelt integration, du kan t\u00e6nke dig. Hvis der er en integration, du t\u00e6nker, at vi m\u00e5ske vil g\u00f8re, s\u00e5 vil vi sikkert g\u00f8re det, p\u00e5 et tidspunkt.\n\nOg s\u00e5 kan du bare fort\u00e6lle os, at det ikke er muligt, og ogs\u00e5 bare en almindelig kod-pr\u00f8velse. Okay, s\u00e5 er du familier med termen teknisk d\u00e6bt? Du kan pr\u00f8ve at bruge det. M\u00e5ske forst\u00e5r jeg det. Du vidste bare ikke, at det ville ske, og du byggede en masse tekniske d\u00e6mper. S\u00e5 det snabbere du forvandlede, de mere tekniske d\u00e6mper du byggede. Og endelig...\n\nDu m\u00e5 betale det op med at re-faktorere din kolde base. G\u00e5 tilbage og sige, at det var en god id\u00e9 p\u00e5 den tid, men nu m\u00e5 vi fjerne det. de regler i Github for det pakistaniske d\u00f8dshus, at de m\u00e5 g\u00f8re pull-anmeldelser, s\u00e5 man kan se det p\u00e5 en tyndighedsbasis, og s\u00e5 minder vi den tekniske dyrke.\n\nAs much as possible About the pull requests, usually how most places do it is Everybody makes little pull requests, and eventually they all get approved weeks are good enough, then we put them in production and we push them up. You don't do constant cold reviews, that's what I'm saying. You're not going to do a zillion cold reviews.\n\nJa, ja, selvf\u00f8lgelig. Det er ogs\u00e5 nogle gange sv\u00e6rt, s\u00e6rligt hvis de har nogle problemer, som de ikke fuldst\u00e6ndig f\u00e5r. Du kan bare ikke have nok til kodrevyen. Ja, det lukker. Hvis det lukker. Ja, det lukker. S\u00e5 pr\u00f8v ikke at have det super granul\u00e6rt, ligesom i folderne hele tiden. Det bliver forvirrende og du forlader tiden. Ja.\n\nMen du b\u00f8r sikkert have pull requests og kodreviews, ellers er teknisk debat n\u00f8dvendigt, og det kan g\u00f8re hele firmaet i m\u00e5neder. Ja. Er det okay, hvis jeg begynder at sp\u00f8rge nogle tekniske sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l nu? Hvis du begynder at sp\u00f8rge nogle tekniske sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l.\n\nYeah, but don't worry. So I want to know a little bit more about the code base, like what kind of software we're using. So far I got that we're using React as our frontend. SuperBase er en databaseprovidere.\n\nDo we have some background code that is... I don't can see the ripple, so like if we have, what do we have on the back end and where does it run? Du sagde ogs\u00e5 noget om Next.js? Ja, det tror jeg faktisk at jeg har. Det er rart. Next.js er sort og slet det bedste, du har til at sk\u00e6re br\u00f8d.\n\nDet er vildt godt.\n\nJeg tror, jeg har sendt det et sted.\n\nHvad siger du?\n\nJa, K-I-C.\n\nOh, jeg vil faktisk kopiere alt her for dig. Det er meget kompromiseret underlignet. Du har ogs\u00e5 teksten i her, ikke sant? Du har Next.js, AppRouter, TypeScript, Chatsie, Radex, Tailwind, SuperBase for databasen Vi har s\u00e6ttet op RLS n\u00e6sten allerede i nogle tabler. Autentikationen er f\u00e6rdiggjort i form for databasen.\n\nEller det burde v\u00e6re i hvert fald Jeg vil ogs\u00e5 dele Super Bass Access N\u00e5r vi har det endelige og alt Realtime-updatering, jeg ved det ikke Vi kalder det en delversal for deployment. Ja, ogs\u00e5 uden at bruge ShardsCN som UI-bibliotek, har vi ogs\u00e5 brugt ting som\n\n21. d\u00f8gn\n\nIf you know that one. I don't know if any of these components are actually actively used inside of the line.\n\nJeg ved faktisk, at der er nogle. En af dem er for eksempel ... Jeg kan vise jer, hvad 21. \u00e5r har v\u00e6ret for os. Denne ville have v\u00e6ret skrevet fra her, s\u00e5 vi har bare g\u00e5et ind i komponenterne, hvor vi sagde AI, Runt, Interface eller s\u00e5dan noget. Og s\u00e5 har vi bare kopieret det som et blok. Jeg tror, det var det eneste.\n\nJeg ved ikke om du kender 21st ever, men det har vi ogs\u00e5 brugt.\n\nJeg mener, det jeg kan forst\u00e5 er, at det her er mere end UI, for det her er faktisk bare UI.\n\nJa, det betyder at du bygger en UI og s\u00e5 f\u00e5r du koden. Ja, jeg t\u00e6nkte at nogle af de blokker m\u00e5 have noget funktionalitet, men det g\u00f8r de ikke. Marketing-blogs? Yes. But usually you just need to hook it with whatever functionality you have to them, so.\n\nOkay. Are these like pre-made? Yeah, these plugs are pre-made, yeah. Okay, okay, good, good, good. It's not generated. Because I was like, that looks extremely clean for... Regenerere stuff. \u00c5h ja, det er det. Jeg t\u00e6nkte ogs\u00e5, at det var vildt. Ja, nogle kreat\u00f8rer er bedre end andre, men du kan sikkert bruge det, ikke?\n\nDet betyder, at det er gode plugs. Jeg har alt. En anden ting er, at jeg ikke kan se det her. Hvad bruger vi til dokumentation? Du mener, hvis vi bruger et specifikt software til det? Ja, er det et specifikt software? Eventuelt, n\u00e5r projektet g\u00e5r i gang, vil vi have bygget en masse ting, og vi beh\u00f8ver at have det.\n\nDet vil hj\u00e6lpe fremtidige udviklere, og det vil ogs\u00e5 hj\u00e6lpe AI-agenter. N\u00e5r du giver gode dokumentationer til en AI-agent, s\u00e5 er det tre gange bedre, n\u00e5r alt er ok. For nu, og dokumentation var ny for os 1,5 m\u00e5neder siden. Vi havde ikke gjort nogen pr\u00f8ver efter det.\n\nLad mig vise dig...\n\nAnd by the way, mate, don't feel stressed or anything. We're eventually going to slowly build up to everything. It doesn't have to happen. No, no. But I put in some... Okay, m\u00e5ske er der noget i den her repo. Jeg tror, der er noget nyt i den her. Vi har faktisk bare lavet en folder, der hedder docs, og der har vi lavet dokumentationer om de forskellige moduler derinde.\n\nI en markdown-file, men det var en d\u00e5rlig m\u00e5de at g\u00f8re det, tror jeg. S\u00e5 det pakistanske d\u00f8dhus... Jeg tror, jeg skal komme tilbage til det, for... Jeg tror ikke, at vi har t\u00e6nkt s\u00e5 meget p\u00e5 det, at vi har fundet et specifikt software for det. Men jeg ved, at de har lavet dokumentationer, som vi har spurgt dem til.\n\nJeg tjekker bare WhatsApp-gruppen, mens vi taler.\n\nMhm, mhm, mhm. Ja, s\u00e5...\n\nJeg tror, at de s\u00e6tter dokumentation inde i Linea.\n\nVi kan altid se p\u00e5 det senere. Jeg ville vise dig, at hver uge er der sendt en opdagelse. Selvf\u00f8lgelig ogs\u00e5 hver dag M\u00e5ske for eksempel er der et blok eller s\u00e5dan noget S\u00e5 s\u00e6tter de dokumentationen herned Men jeg er ikke sikker p\u00e5 om de ogs\u00e5 s\u00e6tter dokumentationer p\u00e5, n\u00e5r noget virkelig fungerer. Det fungerer alligevel. Jeg har ikke set for mange bloggere g\u00f8re det.\n\nmen jeg tror ogs\u00e5, at de s\u00e6tter dokumentation direkte ind i repoen, hvilket m\u00e5ske ikke er smart. Hvilken software rekommenderer du til dokumentation?\n\nJeg har set mange mennesker bruge Dogzilla, som kan skabe IDs og s\u00e5dan noget. Hors.\n\nJeg vil tage et \u00f8jeblik p\u00e5 det her med Sven. Det handler ikke om at dokumentere hver gang i rejsen. Det handler mere om at dokumentere de produkter, du har. og hvordan de fungerer, specifikke tasker. S\u00e5 som du sagde, du forklarede til mig, at vi har dette problem.\n\nher, hvordan dokumentet fungerer, og s\u00e5 forklarer vi, hvordan en udvikler kan bruge dem i fremtidig udvikling, hvordan de h\u00e6nger sammen med AI og forklarer processerne derinde. Jeg vil sende dig et par eksempler. Det bliver meget let at integrere nye mennesker, n\u00e5r de begynder at g\u00f8re det. Anderledes t\u00e6nker vi p\u00e5, at vi m\u00e5 g\u00e5 i 10 timer og forklare alt over og over igen. Og hvis \u00e9n person g\u00f8r det, s\u00e5 bliver det helbredt for dig. Jeg mener bare, at jeg pr\u00f8ver at rydde din egen.\n\nDet er ogs\u00e5 en god ting. Tak. Det hj\u00e6lper ogs\u00e5 at v\u00e6re en del af samarbejdet, hvis muligt. Inside of the repo, I'll have to check also, but inside of the repo, let me actually just check directly now, because I have the repo from Pakistan. Vi beh\u00f8ver ikke at have det lige nu, men eventuelt m\u00e5 vi s\u00e6tte det ind. Anderledes vil udviklingen blive helbredt.\n\nHvis vi ikke dokumenterer alt rigtigt, s\u00e5 vil vi bare blive forladt, selvom det er mindre end f\u00f8r, men det er stadig ikke en god id\u00e9.\n\nJeg skriver bare en message lige nu.\n\nFor jeg tror, at det er noget, Svend har haft ansvaret for, s\u00e5 jeg ved ikke, hvordan det virker. Jeg kan se, at det er to uger siden den sidste gang, at noget blev trykket til dokumentationsfolderen i repoen. S\u00e5 jeg tror ikke, at de har gjort noget indeni.\n\nRepo, i form for dokumentation Ja, s\u00e5 l\u00e6nge de har det i minden, er det okay Det er det, jeg har brug for nu. Lad os ikke g\u00e5 mere ind i det Du har ogs\u00e5 n\u00e6vnt, at de har automatiserede tester, men ved du, hvilken system vi bruger for dem? Skal jeg bare lave en? Kan du n\u00e6vne et eksempel p\u00e5 hvad det kunne v\u00e6re? Fordi jeg er ikke s\u00e5 sikker p\u00e5 at forst\u00e5 det. Har du h\u00f8rt om Gist?\n\nFor eksempel sender vi en e-mail til en modul, der l\u00e6ser modulet, og vi forventer et specifikt udtryk. Vi laver en imitation af, hvad der kommer til at ske. Lad os sige, at du sender en e-mail til et negotieret pr\u00e6s, og endeligresultatet, som du forventer, er, at det kommer til at v\u00e6re en succesfuldt negotieret pr\u00e6s. Lad os sige, at du \u00f8nsker ...\n\nDet er et limberflorink, og limberflorinket er n\u00f8dt til at f\u00e5 25 m2 til prisen af 300 kroner pr. m2. S\u00e5 du laver en automatisk test. Det runder hver gang, n\u00e5r du trykker noget nyt. S\u00e5 det g\u00e5r til bakgrunden. Du t\u00e6nker ikke p\u00e5 det. Hvis det g\u00e5r, s\u00e5 f\u00e5r du det gr\u00f8nne kommentar, og alt fungerer fint. Hvis noget er brudt ...\n\nDu ser, at det er brudt, og s\u00e5 sender du nogen ind for at tjekke. Id\u00e9en er, at vi skal bygge hundrede og tusinde af processer. Vi skal s\u00f8rge for, at hver gang vi \u00e6ndrer kodebasen, at tingene arbejder, som de skal. Nu lyder det meget let, for skabet er stadig meget n\u00e6rmere. Vi arbejder p\u00e5 \u00e9n ting ad gangen. Men til sidst, n\u00e5r vi flytter op, vil tingene begynde at bryde sig. Og vi er n\u00f8dt til at holde dem.\n\nFor eksempel, n\u00e5r vi er i udviklingsfasen, s\u00e5 vil vi ikke \u00f8ge p\u00e5 produktionen Vi har altid optimeret det her Jeg vil bare sige, at jeg kan huske, at vi talte om automatisk testing med det pakistaniske DevHouse. Det har v\u00e6ret Svend, der har haft kontakt med det her DevHouse.\n\nMen det de har gjort er at implementere de her automatiserede Eller i hvert fald det er det de burde have gjort, jeg er ikke sikker p\u00e5 om det allerede er gjort Men at implementere automatiserede tester p\u00e5 de p\u00e5 forskellige funktioner, s\u00e5 det bliver testet hver gang, der er nye kode, der bliver trykket. Er det ikke s\u00e5dan, det b\u00f8r fungere?\n\nJa, det er, hvordan det b\u00f8r fungere. Jeg vil bare gerne vide, hvilket system de bruger, for det er ikke n\u00e6vnt her. Jeg m\u00e5 ogs\u00e5 sp\u00f8rge om det. En god ting om Vercel, den vi bruger til at trykke... er at de har stor st\u00f8tte for s\u00e5 mange automatiserede testningsmuligheder. Det er som om, f\u00f8r du trykker p\u00e5 en site,\n\nDet laver testet, du giver det, og det giver bare en hel liste af alt, der fungerer og ikke fungerer. Det vil v\u00e6re loget, du ser, n\u00e5r du pr\u00f8ver at flytte Supercell, ikke? Yeah, but right now the lock is, the way that right now you probably have set this like it checks in the background if it's working on the server and not crashing and then pushing it.\n\nMen unit- og integrationstesterne skal v\u00e6re s\u00e5dan, at hvis et specifikt service r\u00f8rer p\u00e5 den m\u00e5de, som det er n\u00f8dvendigt. For eksempel, hvis du \u00f8nsker at k\u00f8be et skruev\u00e6rk, s\u00e5 fungerer det godt. Du kan ogs\u00e5 have et test, hvor det er n\u00f8dvendigt at falde.\n\nMen hvis du siger, at det her resultat er det fejl resultat, men hvis det er det rigtige resultat, s\u00e5 er det en n\u00f8gotiation, eller en pris, som det ikke er n\u00f8dvendigt at tilf\u00f8je, s\u00e5 kan du sige, at det er fejlt, hvorfor det ikke er n\u00f8dvendigt, og at vi m\u00e5 g\u00e5 og tjekke det. Jeg forst\u00e5r, at det lige nu kan sounde som om...\n\nDet er brugel\u00f8st at have det, men jo mere man trykker p\u00e5 produktionen, jo mere komplekter det bliver, og nogle gange bryder ting uforventet p\u00e5 den anden side. Og de tidligere vi begynder at have disse tester, de mere sikker vi kommer til at v\u00e6re. Den sidste ting du \u00f8nsker, er for det her at bryde i produktionen for et klient.\n\nJa, det g\u00e6lder. S\u00e5 det ville v\u00e6re som en konflikterende logik. Du har bygget din logik her, og du har bygget din logik her, for to forskellige, to forskellige f\u00e6turer, og nu er de konflikterende. Det kan ske p\u00e5 et tidspunkt, og hvis du ikke implementerer automatisk testing, s\u00e5 f\u00e5r du det ikke i l\u00f8bet af tiden. Det er baseret p\u00e5 det, vi kalder en integrations-test, fordi vi integrerer mulige ting sammen, og nogle gange kan en aff\u00e6lde den anden, og det er meget sv\u00e6rt at forvente, n\u00e5r det sker.\n\nNormalt er den bedste opgave at bare s\u00f8rge for, at det ikke sker. Du f\u00e5r det, n\u00e5r noget br\u00e6nder. S\u00e5 de g\u00e5r og f\u00f8rst\u00f8rrer, hvad der sker. Jeg vil fort\u00e6lle dig, hvis vi bruger en software for det her, og hvis det er s\u00e5, hvilken er det? Normalt n\u00e5r du er i MVP-fasen, bruger du meget lidt af det her til noget.\n\nJeg t\u00e6nker bare p\u00e5 en fremtidig udvikling, for ellers... Jeg var i en firma, der ikke havde det i et \u00e5r og et halvt \u00e5r, og mine f\u00f8rste seks m\u00e5neder der var bare for at fjerne kroner. It was so sad. Nothing worked. They couldn't move for half a year. It's the technical depth. But when you're doing an MVP, you're moving faster, so you can overlook some of this.\n\nAll right, good. This is all I needed to know. Now I have a good idea. Thanks. It's the technical stuff. Ja, jeg er n\u00f8dt til at vide det Og hvis du har nogen sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l, s\u00e5 skriv bare i Slagplan Og jeg vil finde ud af mig selv, om jeg kan svare p\u00e5 det eller om jeg kan finde ud af det ved at sp\u00f8rge Sven i DevHouse\n\nS\u00e5 jeg vil bare, f\u00f8r denne aften, eller i aftenen, jeg vil have NDA, jeg vil sende det til dig. Vi sendte det ogs\u00e5 til Pakistan. Vi sendte det ogs\u00e5 til en anden dev i Bulgarien, som vi fik hj\u00e6lp fra. Han var meget juni\u00f8r, s\u00e5 vi kunne ikke virkelig... Ja. Men s\u00e5 kan du l\u00f8se NDA, og n\u00e5r det er gjort, vil jeg...\n\nstille akses med dig i form for github akses og linear akses s\u00e5 du har akses til repoen og s\u00e5 m\u00e5 vi endelig beslutte, hvor mange timer det vil tage til at g\u00f8re en fuldkort udvalg Selvf\u00f8lgelig, hvis vi filmer i fem timer under eller over, s\u00e5 er det okay for os. Men hvis det er to gange s\u00e5 meget, s\u00e5 er det nok...\n\nJeg h\u00e5ber, at det er muligt at estimere, hvor meget tid det tager.\n\nJa, s\u00e5 kan vi begynde med kod-udvalget, og lige efter det, n\u00e5r vi har f\u00e5et tilbage resultatet af kod-udvalget, s\u00e5 forst\u00e5r du repoen. Eller du b\u00f8r forst\u00e5 repoen en lille smule bedre m\u00e5ske. Ja, og vi forst\u00e5r, hvordan vi g\u00f8r i termer af dokumentation, hvis Sven ikke har en ansvar for mig i aften.\n\nEndt.\n\nS\u00e5 er vi faktisk klar til at begynde middelkredsen. Ja, vi kan absolut trykke p\u00e5 dokumentationen meget senere. Ingen kender dokumentationen f\u00f8rst, ikke engang investererne. S\u00e5 v\u00e6r ikke bekymret. Det er mest en teknisk ting, som jeg fixerer.\n\nJa, det er rigtig cool. Er det alt? For jeg m\u00e5 g\u00e5 og tage min mor fra arbejde. Hun broke hendes h\u00e5r. Ja, godt lykke med det. Ja, selvf\u00f8lgelig, ja. Tak s\u00e5 meget for din tid, Ivo. Bare fort\u00e6l mig ... Ja, jeg er n\u00f8dt til at g\u00f8re det n\u00e6ste, som er at sende dig NDA, og n\u00e5r denne er signeret, s\u00e5 er det access, og s\u00e5 begynder vi at\n\nreviewing and then that mail client yeah so it's basically just tonight i'll send the next one\n\nAll right. That's fine, mate. Thank you, that was a fruitful conversation. Yeah, you too. For the first time that you're going to build us, then... Vi beh\u00f8ver ogs\u00e5 at finde ud af, om du har din egen kompagni, eller om du g\u00e5r gennem Zvezdo, eller hvordan er det? Vi skal faktisk g\u00e5 gennem Zvetomir.\n\nF\u00f8rst vil jeg skrive ham op. Han tog mig ind, og s\u00e5 vil jeg v\u00e6re med ham. Hvis du kan finde ud af det, fordi det er sv\u00e6rt for os at tjene vores salar i Bulgaria, for vi har ikke lavet en firma derhjemme. Hvis du kan finde en l\u00f8sning til det, s\u00e5 er det fantastisk. Og s\u00e5 s\u00e6tter du bare to ekstra timer p\u00e5, fordi vi har spist s\u00e5 meget tid sammen i m\u00f8derne, og i dette m\u00f8de ogs\u00e5, og for at forst\u00e5 det for kodrevyen. S\u00e5 du kan bare lave en separat linje, der hedder to timer.\n\nEr det okay, hvis jeg bare sender dine forhandlinger til en firma, for jeg har gjort det med danskere, britiskere og firmaer fra Dubai, og det er vanvittigt, at der ikke er nogen problemer. Hvad betyder det? Vi arbejder p\u00e5 forskellige tider. Jeg har en firma, der s\u00e6lger en rejse. Jeg sender den til dig, du signerer den, og vi forhandler penge, s\u00e5 alt er korrekt med banken.\n\nOh yeah, you mean like an invoice, right? Sorry, the word for receipt and invoice in Bulgaria is the same. Oh yeah, I understand. Yeah, an invoice, that would be really great. Lad mig v\u00e6re helt sikker p\u00e5 at sp\u00f8rge. Den sidste, jeg talte om, hedder Thomas. Han var min onkel. Han arbejder i bygningsindustrien.\n\nHan er ogs\u00e5 den, der skal betale de her invoices, s\u00e5 jeg bare beh\u00f8ver at... Faktisk, han ringer mig lige nu. S\u00e5 hvis vi h\u00e6nger sammen, s\u00e5 vil jeg sp\u00f8rge ham, og s\u00e5 vil jeg give din reply i Slack. Skal vi g\u00f8re det? Ja, det tror jeg. Perfekt. Jeg vil sende dig til NDA, og s\u00e5 god lukkedag med din mor. Tak. Hav en god aften. Du ogs\u00e5. Pas p\u00e5.", "created_at": "2025-09-17T19:24:27.403862+00:00"}, {"uuid": "f7916489-dcab-4e30-a9d9-9341324dc60e", "filename": "Meeting about Mailclient w.

Hey, jeg kommer hjem igen. Hey, nice. Sorry, I forgot to send the invite. Hvordan g\u00f8r I det? Jeg g\u00f8r det godt, i hvert fald.\n\nJeg sidder bare i parkeringen her, det er den eneste m\u00e5de jeg kan f\u00e5 rid af mine b\u00f8rn. Hvordan er det med dig, Tresto? Er du begyndt eller er det okay? Jeg s\u00e5, at du ikke havde tid til weekenden. Ja, jeg har lavet forberedelser. Jeg havde en sportunders\u00f8gelse et par m\u00e5neder siden.\n\nS\u00e5 jeg skal g\u00e5 og f\u00e5 det forberedt i Istanbul i n\u00e6ste uge, eller i morgen faktisk. S\u00e5 jeg forbereder mig til at flyve. Hvad er brystet? Min kn\u00e6 gik ud af hj\u00f8rnet. Det var helt skr\u00e6mmende. Jeg kan ikke lide det, n\u00e5r folk joiner, n\u00e5r det ikke er den rigtige m\u00e5de. Jeg kan ikke lide det. Hvordan sker det, hvis jeg m\u00e5 sp\u00f8rge?\n\nJeg var bare r\u00f8rende. Jeg g\u00f8r alle slags dumme ting. Jeg hopper fra fly, jeg rider motorbiler, jeg diver, jeg g\u00f8r alle slags dumme ting. Det skete, da jeg bare r\u00f8rende. Jeg gjorde crossfit. Jeg var r\u00f8rende, og den slippede, og pfff. \u00c5h, shit, mand. Det er en fucking sikkerhed. Jeg tog et billede, og jeg var... Du skal til Istanbul for at fjerne den. \u00d8h, hvad? Er det den sv\u00e6reste m\u00e5de for at fjerne den, i Istanbul, eller?\n\nJa, her i Bulgarien gjorde jeg et par operationer, men det gik ikke rigtig godt, s\u00e5 jeg vil pr\u00f8ve at g\u00e5 til Istanbul. Fedt. Ja, vildt. Ja. Vi venter p\u00e5 Evo, ikke? Ja. Jeg tror, du vil v\u00e6re der snart, eller jeg ved ikke, men jeg sendte en link. Er I samme bil, eller er der forskellige? Nej, nej, nej, vi har forskellige biler.\n\nForst\u00e5r du sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5let?\n\nHan b\u00f8r v\u00e6re her om en minute.\n\nJeg har faktisk bare havet en \u00e6gtesk\u00e5l, s\u00e5 vi er f\u00e6rdige i mellemtiden.\n\nDet er en varmt dag i Aarhus, Sven, s\u00e5 det er fint. Ja, det har v\u00e6ret varmt her ogs\u00e5, faktisk. Rigtig fint, som den sidste del af sommeren, som vi f\u00e5r, tror jeg. Plovd\u00f8f er virkelig varmt. Normalt er Sofie okay, men Plovd\u00f8f er virkelig varmt. Det er stadig 35 grader i dagen. Wow, okay.\n\nS\u00e5 kan vi ikke bev\u00e6ge os, men luftkonditioneringen i min bil er meget d\u00e5rlig, fordi den skal fylde luftkonditioneringen. S\u00e5 det bliver virkelig varmt, selvf\u00f8lgelig n\u00e5r det er 25 grader her.\n\nEller m\u00e5ske er det, fordi Sofia ikke er n\u00e6ste til havet, s\u00e5 det er nok ganske varmt i midten der, ikke? Ja, jeg mener, at der er lidt luftfl\u00f8je i Sofia, fordi det er n\u00e6rt en gade, og s\u00e5 har gaden lidt luft, og i Plovdiv, jeg ved ikke, hvilket sted det er, men der er ingen luft.\n\nDer er ingen r\u00f8rende luft. Hvordan er det i vintertiden? Det er varmt som helvede. Ligesom 4-5 grader m\u00e5ske.\n\nVi f\u00e5r ikke meget vinter. Jeg begyndte at k\u00f8re motorcykel, for her f\u00e5r vi m\u00e5ske en og en halv m\u00e5ned af kolde vejr, hvor det er 0 grader. Og det bliver meget varmt resten af ugen. Ja, du kan ogs\u00e5 se p\u00e5 mappen, at Plovdiv er... Jeg mener, n\u00e5r du g\u00e5r til Asenovgrad, s\u00e5 er det der, hvor vi har v\u00e6ret f\u00f8r du gik i munterne, ikke?\n\nVi gik til Sm\u00e5land og s\u00e5dan noget, men Plophtiv er lidt udenfor gr\u00e6nserne, ja.\n\nYes, well, do you guys have already set up? Maybe we should just start. We did some things with Ivo and then I guess if he joins. Vi har skabt projektet lidt. Har I en linjer, fordi vi har skabt en anden? Ja, vi har linear, ja. Vi har linear, ja. Jeg sp\u00f8rger mig, om jeg kan kopiere disse og bare flytte dem til den anden linear, og det ville v\u00e6re meget flot.\n\nKan du m\u00e5ske invitere mig til det? Ja, jeg pr\u00f8ver faktisk allerede. Jeg skal se, hvordan det g\u00e5r. Sven, er du f\u00e6rdig med linje? Ja, jeg har brugt Linear i 5-6 \u00e5r. Okay, s\u00e5 vil du sige at du prefererer det over de andre? Ja, 100 procent. Holy shit, Jura, this guy. That's what we heard as well. That's why we're going with linear. And I would say, overall, my experience has been very good. Because it has the MCP and integrations with a lot of other systems as well.\n\nSkal jeg invitere dig med denne e-mail? Ja, giv den. S\u00e5 n\u00e5r du skaber et nyt projekt, ja?\n\nOh yeah, I mean, yeah, the project, yeah, but not within the same workspace though, right?\n\nJeg er ikke s\u00e5 god p\u00e5 Linear endnu. Jeg sagde, at jeg skulle skabe det samme projekt, men i den samme... Ja, i den samme... Ja, exakt. Make sense. I mean, yeah. Oh, you know what? I should create a team for... I just created the mail client as a project so\n\nLet me just, give me five minutes, I'll get back to you, I'm on it.\n\nHvordan var det, Ivo var din ven fra Teknisk Universitet? Ja, vi studerede sammen i CBA. Det var den her mand, som du gik til Danmark med? Ja. Vi m\u00f8dtes i Danmark, men vi gik ikke til Danmark. Men ogs\u00e5 fra Bulgarien? Ja, nationalt, ja.\n\nVi har ogs\u00e5 arbejdet sammen i samme firma, Rizika, i et par \u00e5r, m\u00e5ske to \u00e5r. Hvad er navnet af din firma, Svetomir? Den nye? Ja. Det er Cosmo Labs.\n\nStart-up, den konsulterende er Deltaport. Vi spurgte bare AI om noget. Okay, hvilken skal jeg invitere? What do you mean? You can just invite my name. I'm just going to create a team in Linear called something like Cosmo or something and then I'll... Ja, sikkert.\n\nMen s\u00e5 l\u00e6nge jeg forst\u00e5r, at Ivar bare er en ven, er han en del af konsulteringsomr\u00e5det, eller hvad du vil kalde det? Ja, han arbejder lige nu p\u00e5 vores start-up, hvor han hj\u00e6lper med at betale for europ\u00e6iske gr\u00e6nser, s\u00e5 han flytter lidt. Det er slice.\n\nMen det er ikke et fuldtidsjob, s\u00e5 det vil v\u00e6re rart for ham at have noget koding at g\u00f8re. Det er rart. Cool.\n\nMen vi skubbede bare det f\u00f8rste, hvordan man kalder det, m\u00f8belstol, som I beskrev der. Men grunden til det var, at vi m\u00e5ske kunne f\u00e5 det til at starte arbejde s\u00e5 snart som muligt, og s\u00e5 kunne vi g\u00e5 videre, n\u00e5r vi bev\u00e6ger os en lille smule. og vi l\u00e6rer mere om problemet Ja, det g\u00f8r vi Det lyder godt\n\nJa.\n\nSpansk shit, jeg sendte Svestos mail indenfor Whatsapp Det er den med Gmail, ikke? Ja, jeg har det her. Jeg har skabt et team. der hedder Cosmo, og jeg vil bare invitere folk her, og i Cosmo vil jeg s\u00e6tte David og Isaac. Men de er de eneste her, og s\u00e5 er der ogs\u00e5 Notion. S\u00e5 det ser ud til, at vi ikke er n\u00f8dt til at skabe det samme projekt som med de andre udviklere.\n\nS\u00e5 det er et helt \u00e6mte projekt, som vi kan arbejde p\u00e5, og Treads America kan bare importe de ting, som de har gjort. Ja, cool.\n\nOkay, skal vi m\u00e5ske runde igennem det, og s\u00e5 vil det v\u00e6re meget fint at m\u00f8de Ivo f\u00f8r vi begynder, men jeg er ikke s\u00e5 bekymret om morgen morgen, s\u00e5 vi kunne ogs\u00e5 reskaldere en ring, bare ... Jeg tror faktisk, det er min fuldst\u00e6ndighed, at jeg ikke inviterede ham, s\u00e5 vi kan reschedule en morgenmorgen eller morgenmiddag. Bare mig og Ivo, selvom Sven er begyndt.\n\nOg Svester, du skal til Istanbul. Jeg kan m\u00f8de Ivo, og s\u00e5 kan vi begynde. Men hvis vi snakker om, hvad din skope er i aften, s\u00e5 kan vi... S\u00e5 har jeg noget at begynde med at snakke om. med AIBO, som vi kan finde ud af med Linea efter kallingen. Ja? Ja, det lyder godt. Det lyder fantastisk. Hvad hedder virksomheden?\n\nNej, nej. Teamet hedder Cosmo, og vi har ikke en arbejdsplads i denne endnu. Nej, men jeg lavede et projekt i arbejdspladsen, og jeg er ikke helt sikker p\u00e5... Men det b\u00f8r v\u00e6re s\u00e5dan, at vi har et projekt, hvor vi kan arbejde sammen i Linea, og vi har et team. Ja, men vi har ikke skabt projektet der endnu. Vi har Line-teamet, og vi har Cosmo-teamet nu.\n\nVi b\u00f8r nok lave et team for de d\u00f8ds i Pakistan, s\u00e5 vi har en interne og en eksterne ting. Lad mig indvise... Lad mig bare lave et testprojekt og se om du kan fort\u00e6lle mig om du kan se det. Du kan bare tage de m\u00e6lkeklienter, n\u00e5r jeg allerede lavede den. S\u00e5 den her.\n\nDu lavede en. Jeg lavede en, der hed Milklind. Ja, hvad det er. Nej, men du lavede den i en linje. Det er en ting. Okay. Jeg er s\u00e5 ny i Linea, s\u00e5 lad os bare g\u00f8re testet. Lad os bare kopiere den der nu. Lad os bare kopiere den der, eller flyve den. Kopi, kopi, kopi, kopi.\n\nUndskyld, om jeg kan eksportere det eller noget? Jeg tror, jeg kan forvandle det til...\n\nS\u00e5dan, nu b\u00f8r det v\u00e6re...\n\nNow it should be in the project folder here, yeah.\n\nPr\u00f8v at se om du kan se det nu. Jeg s\u00e6tter dig i led p\u00e5 det.\n\nI can move it, but I can't move it to your app. For nogen anledning, til din arbejdsplads.\n\nHvis det er en omgivningssituation. Ja, m\u00e5ske du b\u00f8r g\u00f8re mig en admin for bare en sekund. Ja.\n\nMen sikkert, jeg tror han vil svare p\u00e5 mig om lidt tid, og jeg har planlagt en aftale med ham i morgen, og det bliver fint. Jeg mener, du kan f\u00e5 en chat med ham. Ja, pr\u00f8v igen. Okay, en sekund. Ja.\n\nYes.\n\nI did something. Maybe it worked.\n\nJeg h\u00e5ber det fungerer. Okay, cool. M\u00e5ske kan vi bare g\u00e5 over til taskene. Ah, fuck, de blev deltog. Jeg tror, de flytter til din ting nu. And you can just share your screen, and we can figure it out later if you want, so we can have more time talking about it.\n\nSure, but they just got deleted, because I migrated them. Let's just wait a second for the migration to finish. Yeah, of course.\n\nIvo was your guy, right? The consultant that you had picked up? Yeah.\n\nHej igen.\n\nHej hej.\n\nN\u00e5, vi m\u00e5 nok g\u00f8re det igen.\n\nWow, det ser ud som om import og export har flyttet din arbejdsplads til vores og flyttet vores. I stedet for at flytte vores til vores.\n\nVent, har jeg gjort noget fejl? Nej, det har jeg ikke gjort. Okay. Er der en lock i s\u00e6ttingene, hvor vi kan undg\u00e5 det?\n\nJeg kan dele, s\u00e5 vi kan alle forst\u00e5 det. Jeg kan ogs\u00e5 bare g\u00e5 i s\u00e6ttinger. Ja, en sekund. Del. \u00d8h... Jeg sk\u00e6rer min hjemmeside her.\n\nDer er det.\n\nIt's not because you went into another workspace than the one that you used? No, I went here, import, export, then linear to linear. Produkt support, det er denne her.\n\nImport fra Linear Alliance. Det skulle det ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re, s\u00e5 jeg skr\u00e6vde det op en lille smule.\n\nTak fordi du s\u00e5 med.\n\nVi bliver n\u00f8dt til at g\u00f8re det igen, og s\u00e5 gik jeg her og kiggede, og det var ingenting. Der skulle v\u00e6re et projekt med en masse apps. med en masse problemer\n\nOkay, det er ikke en stor deal. Jeg vil pr\u00f8ve at g\u00f8re det igen. Jeg forventer at Evo vil finde ud af, at jeg har spawnet ham. Han sender mig tilbage, og jeg vil bare ringe til ham for at f\u00e5 det tilbage igen. Du ved, at vi skal bygge det op. Hvordan om du klikker p\u00e5 klokken i h\u00f8jre til h\u00f8jre korne, s\u00e5 kan du se nydelig udf\u00f8rt. M\u00e5ske er det et andet sted? Okay.\n\nDu ved hvad? Der kan v\u00e6re en show empty groups.\n\nGod forn\u00f8jelse.\n\nOkay, jeg vil, men jeg tror jeg kan se milestone 1, og det har alle de...\n\nOkay, let's just go with recently viewed and we'll figure that out later. So we have a few big tasks. at skabe integrationer, det er det f\u00f8rste vi skal g\u00f8re. Vi har de tre integrationer, som I ser. Vi beh\u00f8ver ikke nogen ... Vi har ikke brug for nogen design eller s\u00e5dan noget, s\u00e5 vi kan starte det imediativt. Vi forventer, at det vil tage omkring 2-3 dage for integrationen, for eksempel er Google meget lang.\n\nMen m\u00e5ske Outlook eller Yahoo vil v\u00e6re nemmere. Jeg har aldrig gjort Outlook, men vi skal bare f\u00e5 det og udvide det. S\u00e5 ja, 6-9 dage for alt var planen, og vi havde tre s\u00e6dvaner, hvilket var hver integration. Og s\u00e5, n\u00e5r vi har integrationerne...\n\nDen f\u00f8rste ting var at udpr\u00f8ve koden og proposenterne, s\u00e5rlig. Og give jer nogle... Vi kan g\u00e5 tilbage til koden. Du vil have en kode-udvalg, ikke? Ja, det ville v\u00e6re rigtig fint. Vi kan g\u00f8re det. Det h\u00e6nger p\u00e5, hvor stor koden er. Jeg har ingen anledning om det er bare 3-10 eller 300 fj\u00e6l. Vi s\u00e6tter to dage, det kan v\u00e6re to timer, det kan v\u00e6re en uge, det afh\u00e6nger meget af...\n\nHvor meget kode har I? S\u00e5 det var lidt... Ja ja, selvf\u00f8lgelig, det v\u00e6rder sig. M\u00e5ske efter denne ring, vil jeg g\u00e5 hjem og dele... Gets access to the github repo that the pakistan devhouses is building in you can just take a look and you can estimate how long time that will take\n\nOg s\u00e5 har vi denne, skabe e-mail klienter, s\u00e5 ja, vi har faktisk et par sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l p\u00e5 de tidligere, men har I en UI design? Vi har ikke en specifik UI-designer lige nu. Vi t\u00e6nker bare p\u00e5 at skabe appens funktionalitet og s\u00e5 skabe komponenterne. Ligesom de komponenter fra og efter. Ja, vi bygger dem som brugbare komponenter for den grund. Selvf\u00f8lgelig, men designeren skal designere, hvordan din app skal se.\n\nGenerelt kan du have forh\u00e5bentlige udviklere at g\u00f8re det, som at bygge UI'erne selv, men det er aldrig en god id\u00e9. For eksempel mig, jeg skulle ikke skrive kode uden design, for f\u00f8rst og fremmest er jeg designer, og designere fokuserer p\u00e5 en ting, og du fokuserer p\u00e5 funktionalitet, og s\u00e5 p\u00e5 det andet.\n\nog hvordan det ser ud og f\u00f8les og s\u00e5 videre. S\u00e5 jeg anbefaler jer at kigge p\u00e5 nogle UI design. Jeg har en designer p\u00e5 min firma, s\u00e5 hvis du vil, s\u00e5 kan du det. Tale med ham, m\u00e5ske. Eller du kan bare skrive nogle ting op, s\u00e5 vi har noget, vi kan tage p\u00e5.\n\nVi har allerede appen med en lille smule godt UI, men vi pr\u00f8ver bare at lave tilf\u00f8jelige komponenter, som Sven sagde, og s\u00e5 vil vi refinere det i senere steder. efter functionalityen har v\u00e6ret bygget, men du siger, at det ikke er en smart m\u00e5de at g\u00f8re det? Generelt vil det v\u00e6re flot, hvis nogen skriver af designet, og s\u00e5 baserer du p\u00e5\n\nkomponenter og alt p\u00e5 designet n\u00e6ste gang, men hvis du gerne vil g\u00f8re det s\u00e5dan, s\u00e5 er det ogs\u00e5 fint. Du kan bare sp\u00f8rge Ivo, hvilken bibliotek du bruger til UI komponenter? Svend, har du nyhederne? Ingenting p\u00e5 moment, vi fokuserer mest p\u00e5... p\u00e5 funktionaliteten af MVP, og de udviklere har en designer, og de arbejder med templet, som vi har arbejdet med.\n\nsom vi har skabt, som er ShadCN, tror jeg, ikke sant, David? Ja, det er ShadCN, og ogs\u00e5... Jeg tror jeg har pr\u00f8vet det Ja, det er min f\u00f8rste gang Ja, okay, cool, det fungerer\n\nOgs\u00e5, hvad hedder det, den store React-bibliotek, hvad hedder det? Vi pr\u00f8ver generelt UI for komponenter. N\u00e6ste sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l.\n\nHvad t\u00e6nkte du, David? Jeg ved det ikke. \u00c5h, nej, det var her. Det hedder... MUI, tror jeg. MUI, ja. Vi valgte MUI for vores komponenter. Ja.\n\nI was here, you mean you... Yeah.\n\n\u00d8nsker du at se flere videoer? Hvis ikke, s\u00e5 klik p\u00e5 abonneren, s\u00e5 kan du se flere af mine videoer.\n\nHvad sker der? Er du der?\n\nDid you let him in, or something? Yeah. Yeah? Oh, he's still in the... I clicked allow already. Det var en panikmoment. Det er rigtigt. S\u00e5 vi er bare migreret fra din arbejdsplads til os. Og vi har brug for alt det sidste, hvis jeg er sikker. Ja, s\u00e5... Det er altid rart. Jeg er r\u00f8d.\n\nGod aften.\n\nOkay, men at sige, at vi havde tre integrationer, s\u00e5 vi havde Google, vi havde Outlook og vi skrev ned Yahoo. Den tredje var vi lidt uvide, hvilken den faktisk skulle v\u00e6re. Men hvad vi kunne g\u00f8re, er at lave det som en IMAP, s\u00e5 folk kan v\u00e6lge helt af sig selv, hvilken de \u00f8nsker.\n\nJeg er ikke sikker p\u00e5, om vi skal kode integrationen, ikke? Du kan ikke bare tilf\u00f8je nogen... Ja, men det er faktisk bare et sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l. Skulle der ikke v\u00e6re en pre-build integration, hvor du kan... Like have IMAP, so you can have a client that's IMAP and you can integrate with whatever mail system they have.\n\nM\u00e5ske er det en mulighed, m\u00e5ske ikke. Jeg tror bare ikke, at Vermin har en Yahoo mail. S\u00e5 vi skal bare prioritere Google og Outlook. Vi skal se den tredje senere. Ja, de er mest de med kompagnem\u00e6nd, ikke sant? Ja. Jeg er enig i det. Eller jeg er enig.\n\nI will just delete everything. I'll just recreate it in your workspace and that's it. Vi var n\u00e6rmest, vi gik over de tasker, vi skrev.\n\nJeg er ikke 100% sikker p\u00e5, om det handler om IMAP. Det handler om at bygge op integrationen, men s\u00e5 skal man implementere API-funktionaliteten for at f\u00e5 disse e-mail ind i vores system. Ja, okay. S\u00e5 dette kan ikke v\u00e6re for let. Vi m\u00e5 have at se p\u00e5 det, og se. Ja. Den l\u00f8sning, du tager, der kommer til at d\u00e6kke dig helt, er at have en e-mail-server selv.\n\nMen ikke os, men andre robotter, som har v\u00e6ret her tidligere. Vi har snakket om det.\n\nM\u00e5ske vil du gerne snakke med Ivo? omkring 30-sommerige dage af arbejde estimeret. Omkring hvor mange? 30 dage, sagde du? Omkring 30 dage, ja. N\u00e5r jeg s\u00e5 p\u00e5 integrationsplanerne, og du sagde 7-8 dage for integrationsplanerne, s\u00e5 t\u00e6nkte jeg at det ville v\u00e6re en masse mere. S\u00e5 i 30 dage kan du estimere,\n\nJa, det er meget sv\u00e6rt. Mange af de ting er meget uvedt\u00e6gte. Jeg tror, at e-mail klienten vil tage mest tid, to-tre uger. S\u00e5 det tager m\u00e5ske 30-40 dage, men det afh\u00e6nger meget af, hvad Ivo sagde. Jeg troede, at e-mail-kontakten kunne v\u00e6re let, men Ivo sagde, at han havde nogle bryster om...\n\nJeg synes, at den rige tekstformatering, eller hvad var det?\n\nYeah, basically about email storage and all kind of that. Are we going to store emails for the guys or are we going to... Just go through whatever they have in Google and...\n\nDu mener, hvis vores integrerede medarbejderskab... Det er et skrive-og-send-mulighed, s\u00e5 vi har tilg\u00e6ngelse til deres e-mail. Vi stjerner det ikke. Det er godt. Det ville ogs\u00e5, jeg tror, fra en GDPR-kontekst... Det er en no-go, at holde e-mailer p\u00e5 vores server.\n\n\u00d8hm...\n\nOkay, s\u00e5 hver gang de lader e-mail klienten, fjerner vi alle e-mail fra Gmail og viser dem det. Okay. Sveta told me that maybe we are going to go with our own custom text editor for writing emails. Er det virkelig? Eller vil du have et stort sted, hvor alle kan skrive? Blandt tekster.\n\nJa, det er en god sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l. Kan du fort\u00e6lle om det? Jeg er ikke sikker p\u00e5, hvad sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5let er her. S\u00e5 baseret... Er folk kommer til at bruge, for eksempel hvis nogen vil skrive en e-mail til vores service? Hvordan kommer de til at g\u00f8re det? Skal de bruge bare Gmail? Eller skal vi have vores egen textediter hvor vi skriver?\n\nog vi kan have dem som brugbare komponenter, vi kan s\u00e6tte i hver enkelt modul inden for en linje, inden for den software, hvilket vil betyde, at det vil n\u00f8dvendigtvis v\u00e6re vores egen texteditor, ikke? Yeah, well, if we're gonna go there, definitely, because you'll be surprised, but there are not a lot of free to integrate custom text editors out there.\n\nDet h\u00e6nger meget p\u00e5 om du vil have rigtige tekster, som formatering, b\u00e5de tekster, italiensk og s\u00e5dan noget, st\u00f8rrelser af skriver, eller du bare vil have en tekst, hvor det bare er skriver. If I may say so, David, I think, you know, especially considering from a scaling perspective when we want to grow the app and we don't want to go back and change this.\n\nJeg tror, at Reds Editor ville g\u00f8re sikkerheden, fordi vi \u00f8nsker at kunne skabe proposaler og offer overhovedet i appen, ikke? Ja, jeg troede, at der skulle v\u00e6re nogle \u00e5bent-k\u00f8rende... Yeah, it's weird that they don't have that. A text editor with rich text formatting possibility option would be very nice.\n\nDu t\u00e6nker ikke om det, men du vil bruge det i hver eneste mail-klient, tror jeg. Pr\u00e6cis. Jeg siger det, fordi vi fra tidligere oplevelser m\u00e5tte lave en ridstekst-editor, og det blev en lidt sv\u00e6r task. Der er mange \u00e5bent-source-projekter, men det er, som om en firma har lavet noget og lavet det til sin egen custom-case-scenario. De vil \u00e6ndre noget, de kan lide dokumentation, s\u00e5 det g\u00e5r virkelig.\n\nDer er mange, s\u00e5 m\u00e5ske vi kan se ind i, at det er forandret. Landskabets bibliotek forandrer ganske hurtigt. fra \u00e5r til \u00e5r, m\u00e5ske noget, som er fint, som er kommet tilbage. Ja, jeg ser det. Vi m\u00e5 f\u00f8rst opdage funktionaliteten. Ja, lad os se p\u00e5 det, og s\u00e5 kan vi skrive i Slack om denne sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l, men selvf\u00f8lgelig...\n\nS\u00e5 l\u00e6nge det ikke tager mere tid, s\u00e5 er det vigtigt at lave den rige form\u00e5l, som det er nu. For det her projekt.\n\nDet, som de fleste mennesker g\u00e5r efter, det hedder Lexico, og det er faktisk lavet af meta. De bruger det i deres service, men der er mange ting, der er lavet af meta. Du m\u00e5 bruge det for at g\u00f8re det fungerer. Lexical, L-E-X-E-C-A-L X-I-C-A-L dot def There is one main term It's number six in the list that Svetimir sent\n\nAh, okay. Nice. There is one maintained by MUI. I would much rather go with that one. What? There is one maintained by MUI. I will send you a GitHub repo. Det ville v\u00e6re fantastisk, hvis vi ogs\u00e5 brugte MUI, men I sagde, at I brugte noget andet. For nu bruger vi ZCN, men som du n\u00e6vnte, har vi brug for en designer.\n\nVi \u00f8nskede at lave MVP f\u00f8rst, men det er ogs\u00e5 derfor, at vi samarbejder med dig. S\u00e5 hvis du synes, det er vigtigt at starte at tjene p\u00e5 midten nu, s\u00e5 m\u00e5 vi g\u00f8re det. Og s\u00e5 vil vi gerne have, at vi er s\u00e5 versatile som muligt. framework as possible, right? And if that's MUI and we can use that in a scalable way throughout the app, then well, I think it's big for all of us. And then when I say that, it definitely makes sense.\n\nDer er ogs\u00e5 altid plusser og minuser. MUI er den mest komplette, men den beh\u00f8ver ogs\u00e5 en lille smule setup. For eksempel at s\u00e6tte op i m\u00f8rk mod, det tager lidt l\u00e6ngere. Der er forskellige, der var en... Det er meget brugt til farver. Jeg kan ikke huske... Giv mig en sekund, jeg finder det.\n\nDer er en, der er meget brugt til farver, der har chakre og design.\n\nDer er en, der er meget kraftigt til at f\u00e5 dig op og r\u00f8rende, men der er nogle ting, der er missende senere, s\u00e5 det afh\u00e6nger meget af, hvad du vil bruge denne opgave til. MVP for Radix UI. For eksempel, du starter, din team er klar, alt er klar, du begynder bare at udvikle komponenter og skabe ting imediatt.\n\nDet er den, der er snabbest ud af boxen, men s\u00e5 slutter den dig ned senere. MUI er den slammeste ud af boxen, men den beholder, at den har en masse arbejde. Det er meget skabeligt. Ja, det h\u00e6nger meget p\u00e5, hvad I planlegger.\n\nChatsy and UI. And the Verdex UI, I've heard about that one before. Are you saying that it slows you down later on?\n\nJeg har den klar, men Radex UI har den ikke, s\u00e5 du m\u00e5 bygge den selv, og det tager lidt l\u00e6ngere. Men du begynder imediatt, dag 1, du har tim, du har m\u00f8rkt, du har farver, det er smukt og det er fantastisk. Jeg tror ogs\u00e5, at vi er n\u00f8dt til at v\u00e6re bange for, at MVP er den f\u00f8rste milj\u00f8, for eksempel.\n\nVi har bygget hele MVP. Det er faktisk ikke brugeligt, det kode. Det er derfor, vi vil g\u00f8re en milestone med den anden team. Og sige, hvad det er, der arbejder her, og hvad det ikke er. og pr\u00f8ve at se om de er adh\u00e6ngige til hvad vi sp\u00f8rger om. Det betyder ogs\u00e5, at vi skal t\u00e6nke om UI,\n\nVi m\u00e5 t\u00e6nke p\u00e5 den ridske tekstur. Det er det, du taler om. Vi m\u00e5 sikkert arbejde med det i produktet fra tidligere. Jeg bygger lige nu mine egne firmaer. Den f\u00f8rste jeg h\u00f8jrede var en designer, og med ham byggede vi teams for vores produkter. Det betyder, at du g\u00e5r ind i MUI og beslutter, hvilke parter du har, hvilke kornene du har.\n\n90 grader eller 80 grader. Hvilke er dine hovedfarver? Hvilke er dine team? Hvilke er dine sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l og s\u00e5dan noget? Hvor stor de er og alt? Og du har det, og designeren g\u00f8r det ogs\u00e5 i Figma. S\u00e5 du har begge samme team. S\u00e5 komponenterne, du har en exakt replikation i MUI.\n\nOg n\u00e5r de bygger designet, s\u00e5 kopierer du det til din projekt som udvikler. Det er den mest skabelige ting, fordi I begge kommunikerer p\u00e5 den samme m\u00e5de. med de samme komponenter, de samme omr\u00e5der og s\u00e5dan noget. Det er den mest skabelige m\u00e5de, jeg kender til nu.\n\nJa, okay. Det g\u00f8r smidt.\n\nS\u00e5 codereview har du endnu ikke gjort, eller hvordan var det? For codereview vil jeg dele AXS med dig, Tresto og Ivo, du kan v\u00e6lge. Jeg synes m\u00e5ske du og jeg skal hj\u00e6lpe med at ringe i morgen, for jeg havde nogle noter hjemme, som jeg virkelig ville vise dig. For mig og Sven har talt, og ogs\u00e5 med kapitalpartneren.\n\nHvem bestemmer, hvor meget penge vi har for det her? Vi har et budget, og vi vil gerne lave nogle forskellige ting med jer, mens vi bygger den m\u00e6ngde klienter. Vi har ogs\u00e5 snakket om, at vi gerne vil g\u00f8re en ganske d\u00e6kket kod-undervisning en gang. Og s\u00e5 for...\n\nI n\u00e6ste m\u00e5ned vil vi ogs\u00e5 gerne pr\u00f8ve at s\u00e6tte det op i s\u00e5dan en m\u00e5de, at vi hver fredag sender dig, hvad det dev-hus i Pakistan har bygget. og s\u00e5 kan du lave en koreview p\u00e5 det. Det er meget vigtigt for mel-integrationen, at den integrerer med appen, som Pakistan DevHouse har bygget s\u00e5 l\u00e6nge.\n\nS\u00e5 jeg synes, at vi b\u00f8r starte med en kod-unders\u00f8gelse, s\u00e5 du forst\u00e5r repoen, du forst\u00e5r tekstet og alt andet. Vi kan ogs\u00e5 f\u00e5 lidt mere sikkerhed, at det kun er en chat-scene, eller hvad det helst. Og s\u00e5 kan vi mere i detalje snakke om mail-klienten. Ogs\u00e5 den tredje option. Jeg tror m\u00e5ske vi b\u00f8r ogs\u00e5 bare afslutte Yahoo, fordi det ikke g\u00e6lder.\n\nat mindst finde en alternativ og se om det er muligt eller ikke. Jeg vil ogs\u00e5 skrive det her ned.\n\nOkay, det h\u00e6nger p\u00e5 tidsplanen. Normalt n\u00e5r vi g\u00e5r med kodreviewer, s\u00e5 g\u00e5r vi p\u00e5 sprints, og hver to uger s\u00e6tter vi en stor kodreview. Before vi pusher store forandringer til appen. Ja, ja, ja. S\u00e5 det her er kodreviews af koder, der har v\u00e6ret gjort allerede. Exakt. Ved hj\u00e6lp af et andet team, som det team, vi arbejder med i Pakistan.\n\nOg der er bare en masse kommunikationsproblemer der p\u00e5 den m\u00e5de. S\u00e5 vi vil bare v\u00e6re sikre p\u00e5, at det er ogs\u00e5 derfor, vi vil arbejde med europ\u00e6erne. Vi vil bare v\u00e6re sikre p\u00e5, at det vi sp\u00f8rger om bliver forst\u00e5et og deltaget. S\u00e5 dette kod er stadig, at de ting, de har arbejdet p\u00e5, er i uge tre nu.\n\np\u00e5 week 4 i t\u00e6nket p\u00e5 MVP, s\u00e5 det b\u00f8r ikke v\u00e6re s\u00e5dan. komprehensivt af en kodebase, og s\u00e5 er det selvf\u00f8lgelig bygget p\u00e5 toppen af den kodebase, som David og Isaac bygget. Hvad forestiller vi i termer af tiden p\u00e5 det? Hvis det ikke er s\u00e5 stort et koldt bas, s\u00e5 skal vi kunne d\u00e6kke det i et par dage.\n\nOkay, og hvis det er virkelig lille, s\u00e5 skal det v\u00e6re vores, men det afh\u00e6nger af, hvor lille det er. Selvf\u00f8lgelig. Lad os ogs\u00e5... M\u00e5ske skriver jeg det ned, s\u00e5 jeg kan sende det til Slack. Men jeg skriver ned, at... n\u00e5r de giver dig access til github, s\u00e5 kan du ogs\u00e5 lave en estimat i denne her, fordi hvis det er muligt at g\u00f8re det i, jeg vil sige, fire dage, s\u00e5 vil det v\u00e6re en lang tid, fordi\n\ns\u00e5 m\u00e5 vi altid v\u00e6re en uge tilbage, men der er ingenting at g\u00f8re, hvis det hele er for stort. Men vi kan have et estimat og se, om det g\u00e6lder eller ikke. til at lave h\u00f8jtvalgte kode-udvalg eller ikke? Skal vi ikke i stedet pr\u00f8ve at have 4 behov for hver kommit, som de g\u00f8r? S\u00e5 de tager en task...\n\nDe skaber en m\u00e5l, og de laver en pull request, og det udvalger vi, s\u00e5 vi ikke udvalger hele koden hele tiden. Ja, vi kan bare s\u00e6tte det op med dem, faktisk f\u00f8rste gang de gjorde en pull request. Men siden det kun er dem, der har bygget det, s\u00e5 har det ikke v\u00e6ret det. Jeg havde s\u00e6ttet pull request-vinduet op med dem, men de bedte for, at det blev r\u00e6kket, for tiden var forskellig. S\u00e5 hvis de gjorde pull request, s\u00e5 ville de nogle gange...\n\nDet ville v\u00e6re bryllupet for dem, der forts\u00e6tter p\u00e5 grund af tidstilf\u00e6ldet. Jeg ved, at det ikke er ideelt. Det er ogs\u00e5 en af grunden til, at vi \u00f8nsker at lave denne udvalgning. Det ville v\u00e6re bedst, hvis vi kunne udvalge den totale kodbase, som den nu er.\n\nOg s\u00e5, fordi, forh\u00e5bentligvis, hvis det er skidt, s\u00e5 skal vi ikke forlade. S\u00e5 jeg har sagt det, eller vi har sagt det p\u00e5 en m\u00e5de, at der er tre milestoner, og de bliver betalt for hver mileston. Men de har signeret, og de forst\u00e5r, at hvis de ikke har deltog p\u00e5 den f\u00f8rste mileston,\n\nop til par med den kodbase, vi spurgte for, og den produkt, vi talte om, s\u00e5 har vi muligheden til at tage det til en anden hold. For os er det selvf\u00f8lgelig en forbrug af penge, men det er mest en forbrug af tid. Det er virkelig det, vi \u00f8nsker at undg\u00e5.\n\nWell, then we'll have to just check on GitHub first and figure it out. Yeah, I mean that's... Det skulle v\u00e6re det n\u00e6ste Skal vi snakke mere om det? Nu at du er b\u00e5de p\u00e5 Linear kan jeg ogs\u00e5 kopiere MVP-udviklingen som den er nu din team, s\u00e5 du kan se det, du kan se forl\u00f8bet s\u00e5 l\u00e6nge.\n\nS\u00e5dan.\n\nEr der en lignende m\u00e5de at dele det med dig, uden at de ser, at der er en anden hold, for jeg vil ikke skabe nogen...\n\nDet er jeg ikke s\u00e5 sikker p\u00e5. Det er jeg ikke s\u00e5 sikker p\u00e5, ja. M\u00e5ske kan du bare dele din sk\u00e6rm, s\u00e5 kan vi se det. Ja, okay.\n\nOkay, s\u00e5 er det s\u00e5dan det ser ud. Det her er MVP-udviklingen, og vi har skabt det i faser som denne. Jeg kan ikke se sk\u00e6rmen. Nej, det kan du ikke.\n\nN\u00e6h, stille nok for mig at least.\n\nKan I se skjulet? Ja, der er det. Okay, s\u00e5 det er s\u00e5dan det ser ud. Her har vi projektet. Her er de, der er i forhold. Som I kan se, har de begyndt at arbejde med timetracking offline med GPS. Her har vi acceptance-kriterier. Der er de korte komponenter, der er en beskrivelse, der er test, integrations-test, der er en rollback-plan og s\u00e5dan noget.\n\nDemo kriterier, hvad vi vil se, n\u00e5r de viser demoen. Jeg tror, vi har 13 uger i totalt. Her kan du se, at vi g\u00e5r fra week 2 til review, s\u00e5 har vi timetracking offline, projekter, IA-team, skeleton, tasks, tasks, assignment, approvals, so forth. I can just share, I can just take this and I'm not gonna, I can just copy it into...\n\nNo, not the Revivo, but the Cosmo.\n\nHej hej.\n\nYeah, I'll figure it out how to do that.\n\nYeah, well, worst case scenario, just take a screenshot. Yeah, but then I should take a screenshot of every issue, right? Jeg mener bare, at for den f\u00f8rste, s\u00e5 er det ikke en sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l. Eller du kan invitere en af os, jeg mener, jeg tror ikke, at det kommer til at v\u00e6re en stor deal. Okay, jeg mener, det er fint. M\u00e5ske invitere en af os.\n\nJa, ja.\n\nI'm just gonna do this.\n\nBoom. Nu b\u00f8r du se det herinde.\n\nVi har ingenting at skr\u00e6mme om, bare v\u00e6r \u00e6rlig, hvis du siger at vi vil h\u00f8re din oms\u00e6tning p\u00e5 det. Min bakgrund er, at jeg har h\u00f8jere developere end tidligere. Jeg tror, vi h\u00f8jede omkring 20 developere. Men jeg var aldrig en projektleder af udviklere, s\u00e5 det var det, der stoppede med mig. Jeg h\u00f8jde udviklere, jeg havde alle de sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l og de konversationer, og s\u00e5...\n\nVi tog det til manageren af hver departement, som var DevOps, og vi havde b\u00e5de front-end og full-stack. Det var en firma, der udviklede en spilmotor. S\u00e5 det var meget bare metal, C++ developere i begyndelsen og s\u00e5 vidt vi forandrede, s\u00e5 forandrede det\n\nde behov vi har. S\u00e5 det var meget h\u00e5nds-on, men ogs\u00e5 meget holistisk fra min punkt af sejr. S\u00e5 lad mig vide, om... If this is completely off, I would like to know. And we're just learning as we go. Actually you're doing a good job so far. Tak. Det var lykkeligt. Vi laver vores forskning, selvf\u00f8lgelig.\n\nS\u00e5 vi har en god talk om det UI-part, Svester, og jeg synes det er meget vigtigt. Hvis du har noget fra din oplevelse, som du synes ogs\u00e5 er vigtigt at tilf\u00f8je til den UI-talk, som vi skal have. Du kan bare skrive det til Slack. Det vil hj\u00e6lpe meget, \u00e6rligvis. For at lade dig vide, hvad vi har sagt, og hvad vi \u00f8nskede, at du ville g\u00f8re.\n\nJeg mener, s\u00e5 l\u00e6nge vi har t\u00e6nkt, var det noget som skubbede ud hele softwaren. For lige nu er MVP bare en del af modulerne. Faktisk, Ivor, du forst\u00e5r, hvad vi bygger i Total, og hvorfor det g\u00f8r smyket at bygge den her software. Anderledes t\u00e6nkte jeg, at vi kunne hj\u00e6lpe med en...\n\nDu burde forklare dem lidt bedre, for jeg har pr\u00f8vet, men... Ja, ja. Men \u00e6rligt sagt, nu har vi fire m\u00e6nd, s\u00e5 m\u00e5ske er det bedre for mig og Ivo, hvis I har tid i morgen, Ivo. Juste efter nogen, s\u00e5 kan vi hoppe p\u00e5 en kall, men vi kan planl\u00e6gge det, hvis du vil. Og s\u00e5 kan jeg bare fort\u00e6lle dig, hvilken linje og hvad vi bygger og s\u00e5dan noget.\n\nhvilke 4 vi har f\u00e5et, og hvem vi ogs\u00e5 er. Det er fint for dig at vide. Men \u00e6rligt sagt, det er tre deler allerede. S\u00e5 det skubber hele softwaret ud. Lige nu bygger vi... og vi har skubbet ud 4-5 moduler, vi g\u00e5r hele vejen, jeg mener, det er ikke hele moduler, men nogle er bare meget st\u00f8rre funktioner\n\nOg i totalt har vi sagt, at det vil v\u00e6re 20-21 moduler eller funktioner i det samme, hvad vi tror, at det vil v\u00e6re samme st\u00f8rrelse i forhold til koding og s\u00e5dan noget. S\u00e5 det er noget, der kan hj\u00e6lpe dig at f\u00e5 din perspektiv p\u00e5. Hvad vi vil g\u00f8re, hvis det er en afg\u00f8relse, som du vil hj\u00e6lpe os med, er at i stedet for at g\u00e5 p\u00e5 en ringe og forklare, som du husker, Svester,\n\nJeg tror, vi spilte en lille time, bare for at forklare det. Selvf\u00f8lgelig var der ogs\u00e5 en del, hvor vi forklarede en linje. Hvad vi vil g\u00f8re, er at forklare i 15 minutter Looms-videoer. og s\u00e5 lave 20 looms-videoer i 3-4 uger, s\u00e5 ville vi sende dem til dig, og s\u00e5 kunne du f\u00e6lge resten, som vi forventede, at det ville tage omkring.\n\n45 minutter til en time for at f\u00e6lde skobet. Det er i hvert fald resultatet, vi vil gerne se. Hvor meget kan du f\u00e6lde skobet i 45 minutter? En test kunne v\u00e6re meget fint, og s\u00e5 kan vi se, om det er en... direktion vi \u00f8nsker at g\u00e5, eller vej, fordi det kunne v\u00e6re et stort projekt, ikke? Og det ville hj\u00e6lpe os, fordi n\u00e5r vi kan skubbe hele software,\n\nVi kan godt vise hele budgetet, vi kan planl\u00e6gge alt, vi kan planl\u00e6gge tidsskaber og alt. S\u00e5 det b\u00f8r ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re en h\u00f8j prioritet. Men for nu, lad os bygge mail-klienten, og lad os g\u00f8re det, som vi gjorde f\u00f8r, s\u00e5 du forst\u00e5r repoen. Og Ivo, for i morgen skal vi nok have et tal, og jeg vil g\u00e5 rundt og lytte.\n\nJeg vil bare sige noget. Det f\u00f8rste de l\u00e6rer i softwareudviklingskurser er aldrig at pr\u00f8ve at planl\u00e6gge alt perfekt, for det fungerer aldrig. S\u00e5 mange eksempler. Store milit\u00e6re kontrakter, regeringskontrakter. V\u00e6r opm\u00e6rksom p\u00e5 at ikke blive overambiti\u00f8se og overlovede, men vi vil deltage. S\u00e5 vi m\u00e5 v\u00e6re lidt mere opm\u00e6rksomme for det her. Det er en proces. Det kommer til at bl\u00e5b\u00e6re tilbage. Jeg h\u00f8rte faktisk, at vi talte med 10 devs i Bulgarien. Jeg var der for to uger siden, tror jeg.\n\nOg jeg har h\u00f8rt denne tre gange, s\u00e5... Vi har faktisk studeret i Danmark, s\u00e5 vi l\u00e6rte lidt derude, og s\u00e5... Vi l\u00e6rte det fra dig. Ja, men det er fint at have noget i minde, f.eks. at vi bygger en ny modul, den sidste modul tog x antal tid, denne skal tage omkring lidt tid.\n\nsamme antal kode og s\u00e5dan noget. S\u00e5 jeg tror, at det, I g\u00f8r, er... Det er rart. Det er... Jeg tror ogs\u00e5, at det er derfor, I er interessant, fordi I har den danske bakgrund, og I forst\u00e5r... Ja, den m\u00e5de at arbejde, som jeg synes er rart, jeg kan lide det.\n\nNetCompany er et godt eksempel p\u00e5 nogen som g\u00f8r det absolut minimum og bare lader udf\u00f8jelser uanset m\u00e6ngder efterh\u00e5nden n\u00e5r folk ikke forst\u00e5r, at skopen var meget st\u00f8rre end de troede.\n\nDet er en af de produkter, jeg ogs\u00e5 arbejder p\u00e5. Det er bare en tracker, hvor du tracker din tid. Er det okay for dig, at han kan f\u00e5 en m\u00e5nedlig rapport eller s\u00e5dan noget om, hvor meget tid er tracket? S\u00e5 det er let for alle at se, hvordan ting progresser. Det er bare en tracker. Du siger start, og det starter at tracker. S\u00e5 siger du stop, og det stopper. Det er fantastisk.\n\nHvis vi har en alignment p\u00e5, som David sagde, m\u00e5ske kan vi lave et skabeskab om hvor langt det vil tage. Det mailklient.\n\nVi skal starte at arbejde p\u00e5 det, og s\u00e5 kan vi finde ud af... Vi skal ogs\u00e5 finde ud af budgeten, og hvor meget tid vi... Jeg forst\u00e5r, at det nogle gange tager l\u00e6ngere end skoven, Vi har ogs\u00e5 et limiteret budget, s\u00e5 vi m\u00e5 finde ud af, hvor meget det vil koste.\n\nJa, jeg tror at mig og Sven, da vi spurgte sammen sidste gang, vi deltog i to sm\u00e5 skober, som vi kan pr\u00f8ve at arbejde p\u00e5, og s\u00e5 kan vi se, hvor alignede vi er. Og s\u00e5 kunne det v\u00e6re en kod-undervisning af hele repoet, der er fra Pakistan lige nu. Og jeg vil sige, at det forst\u00e5s b\u00f8r v\u00e6re et st\u00f8rre projekt for jer.\n\nend den potentielle hverdags kod-undervisning, der kommer frem. Og den anden vil skubbe en mere end bare en m\u00e6ndsklient, en anden modul. Men vi m\u00e5 bare finde ud af, hvilken vil g\u00f8re mest sens til at prioritere for den n\u00e6ste. S\u00e5 det kunne v\u00e6re en m\u00e5de at teste begge.\n\nSvester, hvorn\u00e5r vil du tilbage til Bulgarien efter Istanbul, s\u00e5 kan vi lave det sidste beslutning, og hvordan vi skal lave mail-projektet? Tilbage p\u00e5 fredag, ja. Okay, s\u00e5 lad os bare... Kan jeg tilf\u00f8je en ting, David? P\u00e5 den anden side, hvis vi begynder at arbejde sammen med jer og vi kan se, at det her virkelig k\u00e6mper op, at det her virkelig h\u00e6nger p\u00e5 exakt hvor det g\u00e6lder for os,\n\nI t\u00e6nket om, at appen kommer sammen, lige som vi \u00f8nsker. P\u00e5 den anden side vil vi gerne vide, om vi har andre udviklere, som for eksempel kan hoppe ind for at l\u00f8fte lovgivningen p\u00e5 Evo, og vi kunne godt g\u00f8re det snabbere. Det ville ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re en god id\u00e9.\n\nJa, vi kan snakke om det. Jeg har ikke developere p\u00e5 standby, men jeg har et par venner, som specialiserer sig i rekruttering, s\u00e5 de kan hj\u00e6lpe mig. Vi vil selvf\u00f8lgelig kommitte os til en l\u00e6ngere periode, for det vil ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re en st\u00f8rre risiko for dig at have folk p\u00e5 standby, der vil arbejde p\u00e5 et projekt.\n\nS\u00e5 selvf\u00f8lgelig vil det v\u00e6re, at n\u00e5r vi har arbejdet sammen, s\u00e5 ved vi, hvordan vi skal arbejde, og s\u00e5 vil vi sige, okay, lad os g\u00f8re tre flere m\u00e5neder, og s\u00e5 vil vi v\u00e6re lukkede p\u00e5 det, rigtig? Ja, det lyder perfekt. Godt. Ja, jeg tror det var alt for mig. Meget flot. Tak alle sammen. Ja, tak ogs\u00e5. Jeg kommer til at DM dig, David.\n\nGodt, tak. fade it out or whatever. It has been a very, very long day. It's actually a long time since our last experience. Sorry. Og jeg vil skrive til dig i morgen, n\u00e5r jeg kommer hjem, og n\u00e5r jeg sender dig access til GitHub. Jeg vil ogs\u00e5 dele det, n\u00e5r det er muligt for mig i morgen at have m\u00f8det. Men Ivo, hvordan ser din dag ud lige nu?\n\nSure. Any time works for me tomorrow. And I'll have better lighting than this. This is sort of an emergency right now, so sorry about that. I don't care. It's all right. Bedre end ingen video, s\u00e5... Perfekt! \u00d8hm... Veldig god lukke til dig, Trasto, i Istanbul. Vi h\u00e5ber, det kommer til at g\u00e5 godt for dig. Jeg skriver til dig i maximum to og en halv time.\n\nFor en tid imorgen. G\u00f8r det tre, for vi m\u00e5 ogs\u00e5 snakke, David. Vi m\u00e5 ogs\u00e5 snakke, ja. Men i hvert fald vil jeg pr\u00f8ve at g\u00f8re mit bedste for at komme tilbage. Ivo, en sp\u00e6ndende sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l. Du lever ogs\u00e5 i Plovdiv, eller hvor bor du lige nu? Jeg bor faktisk i en by, der er 100 km fra Plovdiv.\n\nJeg er meget interesseret, for vi skal bo i Bulgarien i 1-1,5 m\u00e5neder. Hvad hedder denne by? Lodef? Nej, nej, den du sang i. Det hedder Nova Zagora, men det er en meget lille stad. 40.000 mennesker. Jeg h\u00e5ber vi f\u00e5r en chance. Det er sikkert mindre nu, fordi de ikke har m\u00e6rket mennesker p\u00e5 sidste gang.\n\nOg jeg tror, at alle flyttede til det store sted.\n\nTo let you know, I also know a lot of Bulgaria.

Based on our previous conversations, I know this system is supposed to integrate with their existing Seven.git repository at /Users/sven/DEVZ/Seven.git.\nLet me help them push this to their Seven repository. I should:\n\nFirst check if the Seven.git repository exists and is accessible\nCopy the productivity system files to the Seven repository\nAdd, commit and push the changes\n\nLet me start by checking the repository status and then proceeding with the git operations.I'll help you push the Seven Ultimate Productivity System to your Seven.git repository! Let me check the repository status and then commit all the new productivity features.FList directoryRequest{\n  `path`: `/Users/sven/DEVZ`\n}ResponseError: Access denied - path outside allowed directories: /Users/sven/DEVZ not in /Users/sven/Desktop/MCPStrategized GitHub push within MCP directory constraints.I see that the /Users/sven/DEVZ directory is outside the allowed MCP directory. I need to work within the allowed directory structure. Let me check if we should copy the Seven repository into the MCP directory or work with it differently.\nActually, let me use the GitHub MCP tools to push this to GitHub instead, since that's what they have access to and the system is designed to work with GitHub.I see the Seven.git repository is outside our allowed MCP directory. Let me help you push the Seven Ultimate Productivity System to GitHub using our GitHub MCP integration.

I can see the user has a \"Seven\" repository on GitHub that was created today and is described as \"Seven - AI Agent & System Management Platform for business operations, client work, and project coordination\". This is exactly what we want to push the productivity system to.\nI also see there's a \"SevenZens\" repository with zen/productivity features, but the main \"Seven\" repository is the correct target for our ultimate productivity system.\nNow I need to push all the productivity system files to the Seven repository.

The initial registration (May 2023, CVR: 41449152) was a sole proprietorship, but critically, **Daniel Borre B\u00f8bel and his co-founders established Atlas-Consulting ApS on October 3, 2024** (CVR: 45137732) as a proper limited company with 7 employees and a holding company structure. This recent restructuring signals professional growth and preparation for strategic partnerships.\n\n## 1. Atlas Consulting company profile\n\n### Current Corporate Structure\n**Atlas-Consulting ApS** represents the negotiation target, featuring:\n- **Leadership**: Daniel Borre B\u00f8bel (CEO), Andreas Warvsten (CFO/Co-founder), Marcus Wuttke and Alexander Lid\u00e9n (Directors)\n- **Employees**: 7 staff members (rapid growth from 4 founders in October 2024)\n- **Location**: Premium Copenhagen address (H\u00f8jbro Plads 21 B)\n- **Corporate Structure**: Part of Atlas Consulting Holding ApS group, indicating growth ambitions\n- **Philosophy**: Explicit counter-positioning to Silicon Valley's \"move fast and break things\" with regenerative business model\n\n### Service Portfolio\nAtlas offers three core services ripe for AI enhancement:\n- **Application Maintenance**: Stable operations with structured service agreements\n- **Core Application Modernization**: Legacy system upgrades with modular architecture\n- **IT Consulting & System Integration**: Digital transformation advisory\n\n### Market Positioning\nAtlas occupies a unique niche as the **\"anti-hype\" consultancy**, emphasizing:\n- Technology built for durability over rapid iteration\n- Human-centered design with psychological safety focus\n- Long-term value creation over short-term gains\n- Clear rejection of Silicon Valley's dominant paradigm\n\n## 2. CEO Daniel Borre B\u00f8bel profile\n\nDaniel presents as a **philosophy-driven leader** with clear convictions about technology's role in society. His leadership style emphasizes:\n- **EQ as core competence**, not soft skill\n- Trust and self-management over micromanagement\n- Users as humans with \"lives, dreams and vulnerabilities,\" not data points\n- Technology as responsibility to contribute positively to ecosystems\n\n**Critical insight**: While Daniel's professional background before October 2024 remains opaque, the sophisticated corporate restructuring and clear philosophical positioning suggest experienced leadership making a deliberate market play.\n\n## 3. Danish AI consulting market dynamics\n\nThe Danish AI consulting market offers exceptional timing for this partnership:\n\n### Market Fundamentals\n- **Current size**: $1.07bn (2025) \u2192 $4.33bn (2031) at 26.23% CAGR\n- **Government support**: \u20ac62.5M allocated for AI initiatives (2024-2027)\n- **Regulatory driver**: EU AI Act compliance mandatory by August 2025\n- **Market gap**: Denmark lags global GenAI adoption (16% vs 61% weekly usage)\n\n### Competitive Landscape\nMajor players include Netcompany (7,800 employees), NNIT (1,700), and Systematic, but the market lacks a **\"responsible AI\" specialist** - exactly where Atlas AI could dominate.\n\n### Valuation Benchmarks\n- Traditional IT consulting: 10-13x EBITDA\n- AI-enhanced consulting: 25.8x revenue (average for AI firms)\n- Danish premium: 15-20% above EU average pricing\n\n## 4. Atlas's unique positioning as leverage\n\nAtlas's **regenerative philosophy creates natural AI synergies** that competitors cannot easily replicate:\n\n### \"Atlas AI\" Brand Potential\n- **Responsible AI Leadership**: Perfect timing as industry shifts toward ethical AI\n- **Human-Centered AI**: Augmentation over replacement narrative\n- **Trust-First AI**: Transparency and explainability as differentiators\n- **Sustainable AI**: Long-term strategies avoiding technical debt\n\n### Market Differentiation\nAtlas is positioned to capture the **premium segment** seeking:\n- AI with psychological safety considerations\n- Transparent, explainable AI implementations\n- Long-term AI strategy over rapid deployment\n- European values-aligned technology\n\n## 5. AI integration success patterns\n\nResearch reveals clear patterns distinguishing successful AI consulting integrations:\n\n### Success Factors\n- **Clear use-case focus** over broad AI capabilities\n- **Cultural bridge-building** between traditional and AI mindsets\n- **Phased integration** allowing compatibility testing\n- **Talent retention** strategies (target >90% key personnel)\n\n### Failure Patterns to Avoid\n- 70-80% of AI projects fail in IT organizations\n- Cultural mismatch between \"move fast\" and methodical approaches\n- Unclear governance in 50/50 structures\n- Overestimating cross-selling opportunities\n\n## 6. Valuation framework\n\nBased on market research, Atlas's valuation should reflect:\n\n### Base Valuation\n- **Traditional consulting multiple**: 10-13x EBITDA\n- **Size discount**: Lower range given early stage\n- **Philosophy premium**: 10-15% for differentiated positioning\n\n### AI Enhancement Premium\n- **Demonstrable AI capabilities**: +25-50% premium\n- **Responsible AI positioning**: Additional 10-20% in current market\n- **Total potential**: 15-20x EBITDA with AI integration\n\n### Deal Structure Recommendation\n- **Initial partnership**: 50/50 JV with 70% cash, 30% earnout\n- **Performance metrics**: Revenue growth, client retention, AI deployment success\n- **Protection mechanisms**: Minimum earnout guarantees, deadlock provisions\n\n## 7. Negotiation leverage points\n\n### Your Leverage (Harka)\n- **AI expertise scarcity**: Critical capability Atlas needs\n- **Market timing**: EU AI Act creates immediate demand\n- **Alternative partners**: Multiple Danish consultancies seeking AI\n- **GenAI gap**: Denmark's 16% adoption vs 61% global average\n\n### Atlas's Leverage  \n- **Philosophical alignment**: Rare \"responsible AI\" positioning\n- **Premium market access**: Human-centered approach commands higher fees\n- **Clean structure**: Recent corporate restructuring shows readiness\n- **Growth trajectory**: From 4 to 7 employees indicates momentum\n\n### Mutual Value Creation\n- **\"Atlas AI\" brand**: Combines both strengths optimally\n- **Market differentiation**: Unique responsible AI consultancy\n- **Premium positioning**: 15-20% above market pricing potential\n- **Regulatory advantage**: EU AI Act compliance expertise\n\n## 8. Red flags and risk mitigation\n\n### Primary Concerns\n1. **Limited track record**: Company less than 1 year old as ApS\n2. **Unknown financials**: No public revenue or client data\n3. **Small scale**: Only 7 employees currently\n4. **Unproven model**: Philosophy-driven approach untested at scale\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategies\n- **Phased partnership**: Start with project-based collaboration\n- **Performance milestones**: Clear metrics before deeper integration\n- **Client validation**: Require proof of existing client relationships\n- **Financial transparency**: Full disclosure before equity exchange\n- **Governance structure**: Independent tiebreaker for 50/50 deadlocks\n\n## 9. Competitive alternatives assessment\n\nShould Atlas negotiations fail, consider:\n\n### Tier 1 Alternatives\n- **Netcompany**: Microsoft partnership, government connections, but lacks philosophical alignment\n- **Systematic**: Healthcare AI leader, massive scale, but traditional approach\n- **Delegate**: Microsoft Gold Partner, AI Agents team, strong culture fit\n\n### Strategic Consideration\nWhile alternatives exist, **none match Atlas's philosophical positioning** for responsible, human-centered AI - a differentiator worth premium valuation if execution risks can be managed.\n\n## 10. Market timing analysis\n\n**This is the optimal moment** for traditional consultancies to add AI capabilities:\n\n### Demand Drivers\n- EU AI Act compliance deadline (August 2025)\n- 78% of organizations using AI need consulting support\n- Danish government's \u20ac62.5M AI investment\n- Corporate shift toward responsible AI post-ChatGPT concerns\n\n### Window of Opportunity\n- First-mover advantage in \"responsible AI\" consulting\n- Pre-compliance rush for EU AI Act\n- Growing backlash against \"move fast break things\"\n- Premium pricing for ethical AI expertise\n\n## Strategic Recommendations\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\n\n**Phase 1: Validation (Immediate)**\n1. Require proof of Atlas's client base and revenue\n2. Validate team capabilities beyond 7 employees\n3. Confirm Daniel's long-term commitment\n4. Assess cultural fit through joint project\n\n**Phase 2: Structure (Weeks 2-4)**\n1. Propose 50/50 JV with clear governance\n2. Implement Texas Shootout deadlock provision\n3. Structure as 70% upfront, 30% earnout over 3 years\n4. Include minimum earnout guarantees\n\n**Phase 3: Protection (Weeks 4-6)**\n1. Implement RWI insurance for warranty protection\n2. Establish independent board member for tiebreaking\n3. Define clear exit mechanisms and valuations\n4. Document cultural integration plan\n\n### Valuation Position\n- **Opening**: 8-10x EBITDA (traditional consulting baseline)\n- **Target**: 12-15x EBITDA (with AI premium and growth potential)\n- **Walk-away**: Below 8x or above 20x EBITDA\n\n### Key Leverage Points\n1. **Your AI expertise is scarce** - Denmark needs this desperately\n2. **Multiple alternatives exist** - Netcompany, Systematic are options\n3. **Time pressure** - EU AI Act creates urgency for Atlas\n4. **Market validation** - Responsible AI is the future\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n1. **Validate Atlas's substance** beyond philosophy\n2. **Structure governance** to prevent 50/50 deadlock\n3. **Align on \"Atlas AI\" brand** positioning\n4. **Plan cultural integration** carefully\n5. **Set clear performance metrics** for earnout\n\n### Deal Breaker Thresholds\n- Refusal to provide financial transparency\n- Unwillingness to accept professional governance\n- Inability to demonstrate real client relationships\n- Resistance to performance-based earnout structure\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAtlas Consulting presents a **high-risk, high-reward opportunity**. While the company is nascent, its philosophical positioning perfectly aligns with market trends toward responsible AI. The Danish market's AI maturity gap, combined with EU regulatory pressures, creates exceptional timing. \n\nSuccess requires careful structuring to mitigate risks while capturing the unique value of combining Harka's AI expertise with Atlas's human-centered philosophy.

Deal Structure Analysis: Phase 1 & Phase 2\n\n### Phase 1: Testing Partnership (Proposed)\n**Structure:**\n- Atlas delivers customers to Harka\n- Atlas receives kickback/referral fee\n- Harka refers appropriate projects back to Atlas\n\n**Your Objectives for Phase 1:**\n1. **Validate Atlas's client relationships** - Do they actually have relevant enterprise clients?\n2. **Test project quality** - Are their referrals good fits for your AI capabilities?\n3. **Assess Carsten's delivery** - Can Atlas's operations support this partnership?\n4. **Build relationship capital** - Develop trust and operational rhythm\n5. **Gather negotiating intelligence** - Learn about their financials, processes, culture\n\n**Recommended Phase 1 Terms:**\n- **Duration**: 6-9 months (long enough to test, short enough to maintain momentum)\n- **Minimum Volume Guarantee**: 2-3 qualified projects per month minimum\n- **Kickback Structure**: 15-20% of project value for Atlas referrals\n- **Success Metrics for Phase 2 Trigger**:\n  - Minimum 12 successful projects delivered\n  - Client satisfaction scores >4.2/5\n  - Combined revenue target (e.g., \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250K-500K)\n  - Mutual agreement that partnership is working\n\n**Red Flags to Monitor in Phase 1:**\n- Projects don't materialize (suggests weak client relationships)\n- Low-quality leads (suggests poor understanding of AI value)\n- Operational chaos (suggests immature processes)\n- Cultural misalignment (suggests Phase 2 won't work)\n\n### Phase 2: Acquisition & JV Formation (Proposed)\n**Structure:**\n- Atlas purchases part of Harka\n- Creates \"Atlas AI\" entity\n- 50/50 ownership between you and Atlas\n\n**Critical Issue: 50/50 Deadlock Risk**\n**Research Finding:** 50/50 partnerships have high failure rates due to deadlock\n- Cannot move forward when equal partners disagree on major decisions\n- Requires robust deadlock resolution mechanisms\n- 70-80% of poorly structured 50/50 partnerships fail\n\n**Essential Deadlock Prevention Mechanisms (CHOOSE 2-3):**\n\n1. **Texas Shootout Clause** (Recommended)\n   - Either partner can trigger by naming a buyout price\n   - Other partner must either buy at that price or sell at that price\n   - Forces realistic valuations and resolves deadlock permanently\n   - Best when both parties have similar financial resources\n\n2. **Independent Tiebreaker** (Recommended)\n   - Appoint trusted third-party advisor or small board (3 people)\n   - Tiebreaker makes final decision on deadlocked issues\n   - Challenge: Both parties must agree on tiebreaker selection\n   - Solution: Select tiebreaker during Phase 1 goodwill period\n\n3. **Domain Separation with Veto Rights**\n   - You control: AI strategy, technology decisions, AI team hiring\n   - Daniel controls: Traditional consulting operations, client relationships\n   - Joint decisions: Budget, major contracts, company sale, new partners\n   - Prevents daily operations deadlock while protecting strategic interests\n\n4. **Escalation Clause**\n   - Step 1: Good faith negotiation (mandatory 2-week discussion)\n   - Step 2: Mediation (neutral mediator facilitates resolution)\n   - Step 3: Arbitration or forced sale trigger\n   - Provides structured path to resolution\n\n5. **51/49 Alternative Structure**\n   - Slight majority (51% you or Daniel) prevents deadlock\n   - Still maintain equal profit distribution (50/50 economics)\n   - Majority owner has final say on operational decisions\n   - Minority owner retains veto rights on major decisions:\n     - Sale of company\n     - Taking on debt above \u00e2\u201a\u00acX\n     - Admitting new partners\n     - Changing core business strategy\n\n**Recommended Governance Structure:**\n```\nAtlas AI ApS (New Entity)\n\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Ownership: 50% You / 50% Atlas\n\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Economics: 50% You / 50% Atlas (equal profit distribution)\n\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Governance:\n\u00e2\u201d\u201a  \u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Board: 3 members (1 you, 1 Daniel, 1 independent tiebreaker)\n\u00e2\u201d\u201a  \u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Operational Control: Domain separation with defined authorities\n\u00e2\u201d\u201a  \u00e2\u201d\u201d\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Deadlock Resolution: Texas Shootout + Independent tiebreaker\n\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Your Role: CTO / Managing Partner - AI Strategy\n\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Daniel's Role: CEO / Managing Partner - Client Relations\n\u00e2\u201d\u201d\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Decision Rights:\n   \u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac You Control: AI roadmap, technology stack, AI hiring\n   \u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Daniel Controls: Client relationships, sales, traditional consulting\n   \u00e2\u201d\u201d\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Joint Decisions: Annual budget, major hires, company strategy, M&A\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Earnout Structure Best Practices\n\n### Why Earnouts Matter\n**Research Finding:** Most consulting M&A deals use earnout structures\n- **Typical split**: 30-50% upfront, remainder tied to performance milestones\n- **Timeline**: Usually 3-year earnout period\n- **Purpose**: Aligns interests, de-risks acquisition, bridges valuation gaps\n\n### Recommended Earnout Structure for Phase 2\n\n**Upfront Payment: 60-70% of Valuation**\n- Cash payment at closing for immediate value transfer\n- Demonstrates serious commitment from Atlas\n- Higher than typical 30-50% due to partnership nature\n\n**Earnout Payment: 30-40% of Valuation**\n- Paid over 3 years based on performance milestones\n- **Year 1**: 40% of earnout (12% of total deal value)\n- **Year 2**: 30% of earnout (9% of total deal value)\n- **Year 3**: 30% of earnout (9% of total deal value) + catch-up provision\n\n**Performance Metrics (Choose 2-3):**\n1. **Revenue Growth**\n   - Atlas AI reaches \u00e2\u201a\u00acX revenue by Year 1, \u00e2\u201a\u00acY by Year 2, \u00e2\u201a\u00acZ by Year 3\n   - Clear, measurable, auditable\n   \n2. **EBITDA Targets**\n   - More sophisticated than revenue\n   - Ensures profitability, not just growth\n   - Typical: 10-20% EBITDA margins for consulting\n\n3. **Client Retention Rate**\n   - Maintain >85-90% client retention\n   - Prevents revenue growth through churn-and-burn\n\n4. **AI Project Success Rate**\n   - >80% of AI projects meet defined success criteria\n   - Ensures quality, not just quantity\n\n5. **Team Retention**\n   - >90% retention of key personnel\n   - Protects against talent loss post-acquisition\n\n**Critical Earnout Protections:**\n1. **Minimum Earnout Guarantee**: At least 50% of earnout paid regardless (protects downside)\n2. **Catch-Up Provision**: Year 3 includes opportunity to earn missed Year 1-2 amounts\n3. **Independent Audit Rights**: You can verify performance calculations\n4. **Acceleration Clauses**: Full earnout paid immediately if:\n   - Atlas AI is sold\n   - You're terminated without cause\n   - Material breach of agreement by Atlas\n\n**Example Earnout Calculation:**\n```\nTotal Harka Valuation: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5M (example)\n\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Upfront (65%): \u00e2\u201a\u00ac975K cash at closing\n\u00e2\u201d\u201d\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Earnout (35%): \u00e2\u201a\u00ac525K over 3 years\n   \u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Year 1: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac210K (if Atlas AI reaches \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2M revenue)\n   \u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Year 2: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac158K (if Atlas AI reaches \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.8M revenue)\n   \u00e2\u201d\u201d\u00e2\u201d\u20ac Year 3: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac158K (if Atlas AI reaches \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.5M revenue) + catch-up\n   \nMinimum Guarantee: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac262K (50% of earnout) paid regardless\nMaximum Potential: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac525K if all targets exceeded\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Atlas's Unique Value Proposition & Your Leverage\n\n### Atlas's Differentiated Positioning\n**\"Anti-Silicon Valley\" Philosophy:**\n- Explicit rejection of \"move fast and break things\"\n- Emphasis on regenerative business models\n- Long-term value creation over short-term gains\n- Human-centered design with psychological safety focus\n- Technology as responsibility, not just tool\n\n**Why This Matters for \"Atlas AI\":**\n- **Perfect timing**: Industry shifting toward ethical/responsible AI\n- **Market gap**: No established \"Responsible AI\" consultancy in Denmark\n- **Premium positioning**: Can charge 15-20% above market rates\n- **Brand synergy**: \"Responsible AI\" narrative is coherent and defensible\n- **EU alignment**: Fits perfectly with EU AI Act's ethical requirements\n\n### Your Leverage Points (Use These in Negotiation)\n\n**1. AI Expertise Scarcity**\n- Denmark desperately needs AI capabilities (16% vs 61% global adoption)\n- Atlas's clients are already asking for AI services they can't provide\n- You provide immediate solution to their growth constraint\n- **Leverage message**: \"Your clients need AI now, not in 18 months\"\n\n**2. Market Timing Urgency**\n- EU AI Act compliance deadline: August 2025 (10 months away)\n- Companies scrambling for compliant AI implementations\n- First-mover advantage in \"Responsible AI\" consulting window is closing\n- **Leverage message**: \"We need to establish Atlas AI positioning before competitors do\"\n\n**3. Multiple Alternatives**\n- Netcompany, Systematic, Delegate all seeking AI capabilities\n- You're not dependent on Atlas for partnership\n- Atlas may be your best cultural fit, but not your only option\n- **Leverage message**: \"I'm talking to Atlas because of philosophical alignment, not desperation\"\n\n**4. Complete Their Service Offering**\n- Atlas has application maintenance, modernization, integration services\n- Missing AI/transformation capabilities creates revenue ceiling\n- \"Atlas AI\" brand completes their value chain\n- **Leverage message**: \"This isn't adding AI to Atlas, it's creating Atlas AI as next evolution\"\n\n**5. Regulatory Compliance Expertise**\n- EU AI Act requires technical AND ethical expertise\n- Your Responsible AI approach aligns with regulatory requirements\n- Atlas's client base will need compliance guidance\n- **Leverage message**: \"We're not just building AI, we're building compliant, defensible AI\"\n\n### Atlas's Leverage Points (Acknowledge These)\n\n**1. Established Client Relationships**\n- Atlas has enterprise clients with existing trust\n- These clients provide immediate revenue opportunity\n- Building equivalent client base would take years\n- **Counter**: But you need to verify these relationships exist and are relevant\n\n**2. Premium Market Access**\n- Human-centered approach commands higher fees in market\n- Clients willing to pay premium for values-aligned consulting\n- Access to Danish corporate culture and business networks\n- **Counter**: But this depends on Atlas's actual market position, which is unproven at 6 months old\n\n**3. Corporate Structure & Professionalism**\n- Recent restructuring into ApS with holding company shows sophistication\n- Four co-founders (Daniel, Andreas, Marcus, Alexander) provide stability\n- Growing from 4 to 7 employees shows momentum\n- **Counter**: But extreme youth (6 months) is major risk factor\n\n**4. Philosophical Alignment (Rare Value)**\n- Finding another consultancy with \"anti-move fast\" philosophy is difficult\n- Cultural fit dramatically increases partnership success rates\n- Shared values enable premium brand positioning\n- **Counter**: But cultural fit must be validated through Phase 1 testing\n\n---\n\n## 6. Red Flags & Risk Mitigation\n\n### Critical Risk Factors\n\n**1. Extreme Company Youth (HIGHEST RISK)**\n- **Risk**: Atlas-Consulting ApS founded October 2024 (6 months old)\n- **Impact**: No track record, unproven business model, unknown financials\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Mandatory Phase 1 testing period (6-9 months)\n  - Require full financial disclosure before Phase 2 discussions\n  - Structure earnout heavily weighted to performance (40% earnout)\n  - Implement extensive warranty protections\n\n**2. Unknown Financial Performance**\n- **Risk**: No public revenue, profit, or client data available\n- **Impact**: Cannot properly value Harka or structure deal\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Demand complete financials before Phase 2 negotiations:\n    - Last 6 months revenue and expenses\n    - Client list and contract values\n    - Cash flow statements\n    - Accounts receivable aging\n  - Make financial transparency a deal-breaker\n  - Structure valuation based on verified data only\n\n**3. Founder Dependency (HIGH RISK)**\n- **Risk**: Company only 6 months old, likely heavily dependent on Daniel's relationships\n- **Impact**: 20-40% valuation discount typical for founder-dependent firms\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Assess co-founder strength (Andreas as CFO, Marcus/Alexander as Directors)\n  - Demand proof of repeatable sales process\n  - Include key person insurance for Daniel in deal\n  - Structure earnout tied to team retention\n  - Your presence as AI partner actually reduces this risk\n\n**4. Unproven \"Regenerative Philosophy\" at Scale**\n- **Risk**: Philosophy-driven approach untested with large clients\n- **Impact**: May not scale to enterprise consulting requirements\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Phase 1 validates philosophy with real projects\n  - Define clear service delivery standards\n  - Ensure philosophy enhances, doesn't constrain, delivery\n\n**5. Small Team Size (7 Employees)**\n- **Risk**: Limited delivery capacity, potential bottlenecks\n- **Impact**: Cannot handle large AI implementations without your team\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Define clear scope of Atlas's responsibilities vs yours\n  - Plan for hiring roadmap in Atlas AI entity\n  - Structure deal to fund talent acquisition\n  - Ensure you retain control of AI hiring decisions\n\n**6. Carsten Delivery Unknown**\n- **Risk**: You mentioned \"how will Carsten deliver\" as concern\n- **Note**: Research didn't reveal who Carsten is - need clarification\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Direct conversation with Daniel about Carsten's role\n  - If Carsten is key delivery person, assess capabilities in Phase 1\n  - Define accountability mechanisms for delivery failures\n  - Include performance metrics tied to delivery success\n\n**7. 50/50 Ownership Deadlock**\n- **Risk**: Equal ownership creates decision-making paralysis\n- **Impact**: 70-80% failure rate for poorly structured 50/50 partnerships\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Implement **Texas Shootout clause** (recommended)\n  - Appoint **independent tiebreaker** for major decisions\n  - Define **clear domain separation** for operational decisions\n  - Structure **51/49** alternative if deadlock concerns persist\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy Summary\n\n**Phase 1 (Testing Period - 6-9 Months):**\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Validate client relationships and project quality\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Test operational compatibility and Carsten delivery\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Build relationship and trust\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Gather intelligence on financials and processes\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Establish success metrics for Phase 2 trigger\n\n**Phase 2 (Acquisition & Integration):**\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Demand full financial transparency before negotiation\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Structure 60/70 upfront + 30/40 earnout over 3 years\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Implement Texas Shootout + independent tiebreaker\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Define clear domain separation and decision rights\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Include key person insurance and team retention metrics\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Establish minimum earnout guarantees\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Secure representation & warranty insurance (RWI)\n\n**Ongoing Protection:**\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Quarterly board meetings with documented decisions\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Annual performance reviews against metrics\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Right to independent audit of financials\n- \u00e2\u0153\u201c Clear exit mechanisms and valuation methodology\n\n---\n\n## 7. Competitive Alternatives (Your BATNA)\n\n### If Atlas Negotiations Fail, Consider:\n\n**Tier 1: Large Established Firms**\n\n**Netcompany (7,800 employees)**\n- *Pros*: Scale, Microsoft partnership, government connections, proven delivery\n- *Cons*: Corporate culture, lacks philosophical differentiation, may not value your autonomy\n- *Valuation*: Would likely value Harka higher due to resources\n- *Fit*: Good operational fit, poor cultural fit\n\n**Systematic (Large Healthcare IT Leader)**\n- *Pros*: Healthcare AI specialization, massive scale, strong R&D\n- *Cons*: Very corporate, traditional consulting approach\n- *Valuation*: Strong balance sheet enables higher valuation\n- *Fit*: Good technical fit, poor cultural fit\n\n**NNIT (1,700 employees)**\n- *Pros*: Healthcare IT specialist, enterprise relationships\n- *Cons*: Traditional approach, less innovative culture\n- *Valuation*: Moderate, would see Harka as capability acquisition\n- *Fit*: Moderate fit across dimensions\n\n**Tier 2: Better Cultural Fits**\n\n**Implement Consulting Group**\n- *Pros*: Danish-origin, strong local market, ~500 employees, growth-oriented\n- *Cons*: Still fairly corporate, less explicit values-driven positioning\n- *Valuation*: Moderate to strong\n- *Fit*: Good balance of scale and culture\n\n**Delegate (Microsoft Gold Partner)**\n- *Pros*: AI Agents team, Microsoft ecosystem, strong culture\n- *Cons*: Smaller than Tier 1 options, different market positioning\n- *Valuation*: Would see strong strategic value\n- *Fit*: Strong technical and cultural alignment\n\n**Tier 3: Build Independent**\n\n**Harka Remains Independent**\n- *Pros*: Complete autonomy, no integration risk, full upside capture\n- *Cons*: Slower client acquisition, limited enterprise access, need own sales\n- *Valuation*: N/A (you retain 100%)\n- *Fit*: Perfect fit with yourself\n\n### Strategic Consideration\n**Research Finding:** None of the alternatives match Atlas's explicit philosophical positioning for responsible, human-centered AI.\n\n**Implication**: Atlas's values-driven approach is genuinely rare and valuable **IF** it proves commercially viable. This justifies exploring the partnership **with strong risk protections**.\n\n**Your BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)**:\n- Primary: Remain independent and build Harka's enterprise sales\n- Secondary: Partner with Delegate or Implement Consulting Group\n- Tertiary: Acquisition by Netcompany/Systematic at higher valuation but less autonomy\n\n---\n\n## 8. Negotiation Strategy & Tactics\n\n### Your Negotiating Posture: **Confident Collaboration**\n\n**Mindset:**\n- You're exploring a partnership of equals, not begging for acquisition\n- Atlas needs your AI capabilities as much as you need their client access\n- Your leverage is actually stronger than theirs given market timing\n- Phase 1 is as much your evaluation of them as theirs of you\n\n**Tone:**\n- Enthusiastic about philosophical alignment\n- Pragmatic about business realities and risk management\n- Professional about financial expectations\n- Collaborative on finding win-win structure\n\n### Opening Position (First Substantive Discussion)\n\n**Your Core Message:**\n\"Daniel, I'm excited about the Atlas AI vision - combining your responsible consulting philosophy with my AI expertise is perfectly timed for the market. I want to find a structure that protects both of us while we test if this partnership truly works.\"\n\n**Phase 1 Proposals:**\n1. **Duration**: 6-9 month testing period\n2. **Volume**: Minimum 2-3 qualified AI projects per month\n3. **Compensation**: 15-20% kickback on projects Atlas refers\n4. **Success Metrics**: Define clear triggers for Phase 2 (revenue, projects, satisfaction)\n5. **Exit Option**: Either party can walk away if Phase 1 doesn't work\n\n**Phase 2 Framework** (Don't negotiate details yet, establish principles):\n1. **Valuation**: Based on verified financials using market multiples (12-15x EBITDA)\n2. **Structure**: 60-70% upfront, 30-40% earnout over 3 years\n3. **Governance**: 50/50 ownership with Texas Shootout deadlock resolution\n4. **Roles**: You as CTO/AI Strategy, Daniel as CEO/Client Relations\n5. **Protection**: Minimum earnout guarantees and clear exit mechanisms\n\n### Critical Questions to Ask Daniel\n\n**About Atlas's Business:**\n1. \"What was Atlas's revenue and EBITDA for the last 6 months since founding?\"\n2. \"Can you share your client list and typical project sizes?\"\n3. \"What percentage of your clients have asked about AI capabilities?\"\n4. \"How many consultants do you have capacity to deploy?\"\n5. \"What are your growth targets for the next 2-3 years?\"\n\n**About the Partnership:**\n1. \"How do you envision the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 working?\"\n2. \"What would make you confident that Phase 1 was successful?\"\n3. \"How do you think about decision-making in a 50/50 partnership?\"\n4. \"What happens if we disagree on a major strategic decision?\"\n5. \"What's your vision for Atlas AI in 3-5 years?\"\n\n**About Carsten (Critical Clarity Needed):**\n1. \"Help me understand Carsten's role - is he delivery lead, sales, operations?\"\n2. \"What's his track record on similar partnerships or client work?\"\n3. \"How do you handle situations where delivery doesn't meet expectations?\"\n4. \"Will Carsten be part of the Atlas AI entity or remain in traditional Atlas?\"\n\n**About Financials & Structure:**\n1. \"How do you think Harka should be valued given market conditions?\"\n2. \"What would you need to see to justify the valuation I'm proposing?\"\n3. \"Are you comfortable with earnout structures tied to performance?\"\n4. \"How do you think about sharing profits vs reinvesting for growth?\"\n5. \"What level of financial transparency are you comfortable providing?\"\n\n### Handling Objections\n\n**Objection: \"50/50 seems high for Harka's value\"**\n*Response*: \"Daniel, we're not valuing just Harka's current state - we're valuing the creation of Atlas AI. My AI expertise and Harka's capabilities represent 50% of the new entity's value proposition. Your clients need AI, and I'm bringing the solution that makes Atlas competitive for the next decade.\"\n\n**Objection: \"Phase 1 volume guarantees seem aggressive\"**\n*Response*: \"If Atlas can't deliver 2-3 qualified AI projects per month to a quality AI consultancy, it tells us about actual market demand. I'm not asking for projects you don't have - I'm asking for validation that this partnership has commercial viability.\"\n\n**Objection: \"Earnout structure is too complex\"**\n*Response*: \"Earnouts are standard in consulting M&A precisely because they align interests and de-risk the deal. Given Atlas is only 6 months old, performance-based payments protect both of us. I'm actually being generous with 60-70% upfront when market standard is 30-50%.\"\n\n**Objection: \"We don't need all these deadlock mechanisms\"**\n*Response*: \"I hope we never use them either. But 70-80% of 50/50 partnerships fail due to deadlock, and I want our partnership to be in the successful 20-30%. These mechanisms are insurance we'll never need if we work well together.\"\n\n**Objection: \"Financial transparency before Phase 2 seems premature\"**\n*Response*: \"That's actually a red flag for me, Daniel. If we can't be completely transparent about financials, we can't build the trust needed for 50/50 partnership. I need to understand what I'm buying into, just as you need to understand Harka's capabilities.\"\n\n### Walk-Away Points (Non-Negotiable)\n\n**Dealbreakers:**\n1. Refusal to provide financial transparency before Phase 2\n2. Unwillingness to implement professional deadlock resolution mechanisms\n3. Inability to demonstrate legitimate client relationships in Phase 1\n4. Resistance to performance-based earnout structure\n5. Demands for valuation that ignore market multiples and AI premium\n6. Insistence on decision-making structure that creates guaranteed deadlock\n7. Refusal to define clear success metrics and exit options\n\n**Flexibility Points** (Willing to Compromise):\n- Exact percentage split on Phase 1 kickbacks (anywhere 12-20% is reasonable)\n- Phase 1 duration (6-12 months both work)\n- Upfront/earnout ratio (anywhere 60/40 to 70/30 is acceptable)\n- Specific choice of deadlock mechanism (Texas Shootout, tiebreaker, or domain separation all work)\n- Your specific title (CTO, Managing Partner AI, Chief AI Officer all fine)\n- Exact earnout metrics (mix of revenue/EBITDA/retention/satisfaction all reasonable)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Valuation Negotiation Framework\n\n### Your Opening Valuation Position\n\n**Step 1: Establish Harka's Baseline Value**\n\"Before we discuss valuation, let's align on methodology. For consulting firms, we'd typically use 10-13x EBITDA or 1-3x revenue multiples, adjusted for specific factors.\"\n\n**Step 2: Introduce AI Premium**\n\"However, we're not valuing traditional consulting here - we're creating an AI consulting entity. Research shows AI consulting commands 25.8x revenue multiples in M&A, with companies demonstrating AI capabilities getting 15-25% premiums.\"\n\n**Step 3: Position the \"Atlas AI\" Premium**\n\"The 'Atlas AI' entity we're creating isn't Harka + Atlas. It's a new market category: Denmark's first explicit 'Responsible AI' consultancy. That unique positioning, timed with the EU AI Act, justifies premium valuation.\"\n\n**Step 4: Anchor Your Range**\n\"Based on Harka's current [revenue/EBITDA], market multiples, and the AI premium, I'd value Harka's contribution to Atlas AI at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac[X] to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac[Y], targeting the midpoint of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac[Z].\"\n\n### Valuation Components to Discuss\n\n**Harka's Tangible Assets:**\n- Current revenue and EBITDA\n- Client contracts and pipeline\n- Proprietary AI methodologies and IP\n- Your personal expertise and industry reputation\n- Existing team capabilities\n\n**Harka's Intangible Value in \"Atlas AI\" Context:**\n- Completes Atlas's service offering\n- Enables premium \"Responsible AI\" positioning\n- Accelerates Atlas's growth into high-margin services\n- Provides competitive differentiation\n- Reduces Atlas's time-to-market by 18-24 months\n\n**Market-Driven Multipliers:**\n- **Base Consulting**: 10-13x EBITDA \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Apply to base Harka value\n- **AI Premium**: +25-50% \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Applied for demonstrated AI capabilities\n- **Niche Premium**: +10-20% \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Applied for \"Responsible AI\" positioning\n- **Founder Risk Discount**: -15-25% \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Reduced by partnership structure\n\n### Example Valuation Negotiation\n\n**Scenario: Harka Revenue \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400K, EBITDA \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100K (estimated)**\n\n**Your Opening Position (High Anchor):**\n\"Based on Harka's \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400K revenue, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100K EBITDA, and market multiples for AI consulting, I value Harka's contribution at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5M-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac2M. Here's how I arrived at that:\n- Base EBITDA multiple: 15x \u00c3\u2014 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100K = \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5M\n- AI capabilities premium (+30%): +\u00e2\u201a\u00ac450K\n- Responsible AI positioning (+15%): +\u00e2\u201a\u00ac225K\n- Partnership discount (-15%): -\u00e2\u201a\u00ac262K\n- **Total Range: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5M-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.9M, targeting \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.7M**\"\n\n**Expected Atlas Counter (Low Anchor):**\n\"That seems high for a 6-month-old company. Based on early-stage consulting multiples, I'd value Harka at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800K-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1M:\n- Early-stage EBITDA multiple: 8x \u00c3\u2014 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100K = \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800K\n- Growth potential adjustment (+20%): +\u00e2\u201a\u00ac160K\n- **Total: ~\u00e2\u201a\u00ac960K**\"\n\n**Your Response (Justify Premium):**\n\"I understand the concern about age, but we're not valuing Harka as a standalone early-stage consultancy. We're valuing Harka's contribution to creating Atlas AI - a fundamentally different market category. The AI premium isn't speculation; it's market data showing AI consulting commands 25x revenue multiples. Let's work from the middle: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3M with a 35% earnout structure that rewards both of us if Atlas AI succeeds.\"\n\n**Settlement Zone: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1M-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5M**\n- Likely settle around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2M-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3M\n- Structure: 65% upfront (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac780K-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac845K), 35% earnout (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac420K-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac455K)\n- Earnout tied to Atlas AI performance, not Harka standalone\n\n### Valuation Discussion Tactics\n\n**Tactic 1: Market Data Anchoring**\n- Always reference market multiples and comparable deals\n- Use the 25.8x AI M&A multiple as high anchor\n- Position your valuation as \"market-based, not ego-based\"\n\n**Tactic 2: Future Value Framing**\n- Emphasize you're valuing Atlas AI's potential, not just Harka's past\n- \"In 3 years, Atlas AI could be 3x the size of Atlas + Harka separately\"\n- Focus conversation on value creation, not value transfer\n\n**Tactic 3: Earnout as Bridge**\n- Use earnout to bridge valuation gap\n- \"If you think \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5M is high, let's structure 40% earnout - you only pay full price if we deliver\"\n- Makes higher valuation palatable by tying to performance\n\n**Tactic 4: Comparable Transaction References**\n- \"When Valcon acquired Beyond Advisors (20 consultants), the multiple was...\"\n- \"Recent Danish consulting deals in the \u00e2\u201a\u00acX-Y range used Z multiples...\"\n- External validation strengthens your position\n\n**Tactic 5: Walk-Away Willingness**\n- Be prepared to say: \"If we're far apart on valuation, maybe Phase 1 helps us gather data for a more informed Phase 2 discussion\"\n- Demonstrates you're not desperate for the deal\n- Often brings other party back to reasonable range\n\n---\n\n## 10.

Deal Structure Options (Three Scenarios)\n\n### **Option A: Conservative (Lowest Risk)**\n**Structure:**\n- Phase 1: 9-month testing period with lower volume commitments (1-2 projects/month)\n- Phase 2: 70% upfront, 30% earnout over 4 years\n- Governance: 51/49 split (you 51%) with veto rights for Daniel on major decisions\n- Valuation: Conservative multiple (10-12x EBITDA)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Maximum risk protection for you\n- Longer testing period builds more confidence\n- Majority control prevents deadlock\n- Easier to walk away if concerns emerge\n\n**Cons:**\n- Lower upfront payment than alternatives\n- May take longer to achieve full value\n- Daniel may resist non-equal ownership\n- Longer earnout period increases execution risk\n\n**Best For:** If financial security is top priority and you can afford to wait\n\n### **Option B: Balanced (Recommended)**\n**Structure:**\n- Phase 1: 6-month testing period with clear volume guarantees (2-3 projects/month)\n- Phase 2: 65% upfront, 35% earnout over 3 years\n- Governance: 50/50 with Texas Shootout + independent tiebreaker\n- Valuation: Market multiple with AI premium (12-15x EBITDA)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Balances risk and reward effectively\n- True partnership structure appeals to values-driven culture\n- Robust deadlock mechanisms prevent paralysis\n- Earnout rewards success without extreme risk\n\n**Cons:**\n- 50/50 structure requires strong trust and mechanisms\n- Mid-range upfront payment may feel neither here nor there\n- Relies on deadlock mechanisms working in practice\n\n**Best For:** If cultural fit and long-term partnership are priorities\n\n### **Option C: Aggressive (Highest Reward)**\n**Structure:**\n- Phase 1: 4-month rapid testing period with high volume commitments (3-4 projects/month)\n- Phase 2: 60% upfront, 40% earnout over 2 years (accelerated)\n- Governance: 50/50 with domain separation and quarterly reviews\n- Valuation: Premium multiple with full AI value (15-17x EBITDA)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Highest valuation reflects full AI market premium\n- Faster path to full value realization (2 years vs 3-4)\n- Shorter Phase 1 maintains momentum\n- High commitments force early validation\n\n**Cons:**\n- Highest risk if Atlas can't deliver volume\n- Shorter earnout period means less risk protection\n- Aggressive timeline may strain relationship\n- Higher valuation may be harder to justify to Atlas\n\n**Best For:** If you're confident in Atlas's capabilities and want fastest value realization\n\n---\n\n## 12.

Okay, then it's correct, Mik. Yeah, alright, let's look at... I'll scroll up a bit and see what you wrote. Oh yeah! We are talking about refactoring, rebuild or hybrid. Hybrid is not an option. There is no back-end for what I can say. It might make sense if there could be a B2B SaaS.\n\nThe problem is that if you switch to the backend, they haven't separated the layers. They just move it to the next API, for example. A hybrid will be a big refactoring, so we might as well restart the whole thing. Yeah, so rebuild and refactor, but refactor requires...\n\nSuper, Marl. Now you can work. The problem with refactoring is that you have a database or codebase.\n\nIt becomes more refactoring and you polish something that maybe wouldn't exist. I can show you an example on the UI where I just had this. I just started editing and deleted a lot of things to start with.\n\nThey just put everything in a list here. But do they handle scenarios when you have 50 questions? I don't know. And it's on all components. So for all components, you can expect that they don't have... Because I don't see... There has only been one video where they have had proper data. In quotation marks, or whatever you should say.\n\nThey changed it last night, but I wrote notes on it yesterday. The first thing I thought was that it would look completely fucked up when it became Fair Tasks. And the first thing I tested was that it looked like this.\n\nI don't know if you can see it that well.\n\nYou see, now they have changed it, but the problem is still that it will only expand. Some of you have probably had 5-6 tasks, and then you're completely fucked. If you managed to work together on all tasks, you're also... Yeah, that's just one thing. If they have the right data, they want to see it.\n\nYes, but it's not really the same here. It's not really the same problem, but... Yes, I can only show that I have uploaded it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Where can I go?\n\nIt's relatively simple to fix. It's just that there are no separate layers. So I can't pinpoint and quickly isolate it. The file is here. You can see it in several places. For example, this one on tasks. It shows daily tasks. This should just be a list for example. Instead we have components and a lot of extra code. It's not a book for that. This is an MVP. It should just be a list that is a table.\n\nTo make it nice now, you update just one component and UI components that you should fix to mobile and everything else. This should just be one line. For example, this shows a lot of data that already exists on the line here. This can just be a button.\n\nBoth of these can be one line with one button that is completed or not completed, just a toggle. Or whatever, for example. It can be a mini-chord. It will be minicode, it will be through popup, it will be much easier and we can just expand it a lot later and it will be a much simpler example. Here is an example here too.\n\nThey have added some dropdowns here, where it shows the exact same data as there. It's the same here. Here they don't have any data at all. A drop-down like this, when you have completed a task in six months, I want to have more than 100 tasks. You don't want to contribute to anything.\n\nIt's just an example of where they just see that it weighs, but it's just extra things. It's all this, and it's just a table. You can use React Table. I can show you, for example, I have set up our Getting Started React project now, because I want us to use the same architecture on our project, and then we're going to\n\nWe will have an integration to SharePoint on our CV solution, where we will generate CVs. And I have... CVs. Yeah. And then I started to implement an integration to SharePoint. I did this in a couple of hours. Two or three hours. Where we have integration and retrieve all data from SharePoint.\n\nAnd then we're going to pick up the documents. All of this... I can... This is just a table. I can filter this in the same way you have with pending task completed. It basically comes out of the box. So that's why I think that we should start with tables on all components, and when there is too much data, or if there is another measure that is better to show it on, if some of the bridges, for example, say\n\nWe want the tasks to be shown in a better way, so there is more focus on the latest task. So I just change it, so you can just expand it. It's just that this standard React component that you connect with the API call to the database. So, for example, you can put this in the background so that it refreshes every other second, for example.\n\nIf you work with someone who wants to be shown directly, it's probably a lie. You can expand on that. They have just answered for themselves that it is not standard library, but that is it.\n\nYeah, but these screenshots and then there are some small things like this. I have just noted down all kinds of things now. I know you said I should focus on the weeks and such, but that's why I mean that it's about to happen.\n\nHere it is exactly the same. It is in several places where it shows the same data on several components. So this is extra code, more stuff that can go wrong. More code like Cloud and Cursor and all the others you need to get into your context and fix every time you work with them. But okay, let's talk about tomorrow.\n\nI say you will see it.\n\nYes, I also want to say that... How is it... He also catches some of the things they do. We're naming and all of that. What I'm sending to you, I think is also included.\n\nYeah.\n\nNo, and that's why I asked the chat, if anyone has ever said no, that this could give meaning. Because often, especially with... It is the responsibility of the developer to communicate and see when something is perceived as wrong. Or when something is perceived to be done in a bad way.\n\nYes. Then there are a few things that I see that are specific to Cursor and Cloud Sonnet. It generates the same sound for me, if I don't see it. For example, it adds actions in the tables they have, which are completely unnecessary. It's simple. It's just a smoothing scene.\n\nYes, but that's also the thing with tables. You can just add a... I mean, with tables you can just add a semicolon and then you get a formula which is exactly the same as... It is where you see the information and where you edit the information. It is always one.\n\nIt becomes summer memory code. It becomes better code. It looks better, because it looks the same. How it is formulated can be changed, but it is the same in edit, it is the same in presentation, it is the same in presentation. It is the same flow. For example, and I can also show an example from Uine where...\n\nI can open up a line. No, I think I showed you yesterday that it opened step-by-step. And it was the same, I think it was on a project. I have many examples I can show you tomorrow.\n\nYeah, I have some screen recordings now.\n\nThis is Obsidian. This is just a markdown file. This is just a note.\n\nBut yeah, if I had taken over this project, I would have refactored 100%.\n\nAnd I want to be very clear that I don't see it just because you are going to clean up Atlas. It's my honest truth.\n\nAnd I want to be very clear about that with Tomas tomorrow. Because that's when we're going to come in and I'm going to... I mean, I don't have much positive to say or what to say. Ehm... And... I'm not the best at it either. I've made a lot of mistakes as well.\n\nIt has been edited to include proper punctuation.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes, we can imagine that, because I thought it was more complicated in the beginning, because the first thing I read was the email client. I seriously believe that in one year I can get this to work with tables and all that. It's much simpler.\n\nIf I work all by myself, the problem is that I have to go out to a customer and say, OK, maybe I shouldn't fix the clean-up database, because the database has a lot of tables that can't be saved.\n\nThe Norwegian MVP was done.\n\nFour or five years. And it is... wait, let's just... I'll just take up a line.\n\nMe and Gubar have both worked with React. We can probably get it online as a full refactor.\n\nI don't fully rebuild.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is the English-Danish. You change it once.\n\nSorry, this should also just be a list to start with.\n\nThe visuals are a part of the song. So you sell it to a DACON or RANDOM who can connect to it, or a DACON who sells it to customers. On B2B it's nice to have a full single-page application.\n\nTo start with, especially if you're going to have an MVP. That's the kind of thing, it should be simpler with an MVP. But also, if you do the MVP correctly where you separate... I don't know if you can see it, but I'm off-back-ending. It's an identity...\n\nSo you can keep that part. You can keep that part. So, Super Bass Backend. But I haven't looked at it that much. It's a way to start, but it's also a standard thing in a way. I didn't expect it to be so much money, because I saw that you had changed something with it as well.\n\nLet's see. Let's see, I have to start with another screen. Okay, push... Excuse me, I just want to note down what should be included in the MVP, if we take...\n\nYeah, we've done it.\n\nYeah, so put dashboard on. Yeah.\n\nYes, but the project page is going to include...\n\nExcuse me. I don't think this is in the database. I don't think this is in the database.\n\nBye. Bye everybody, I hope I won't see you again.\n\nLearning day, learning day.\n\nBut is it just supposed to be there to show off or what?\n\nWe have staff here already. Or is it tasks? It's tasks for staff.\n\nBoth calendars and tables should be included.\n\nDrawing register.\n\nTime checking, it has to be me or it has to be a table. It didn't ask us laters.\n\nTime.\n\nCustomers. Good enough. Ska den var med.\n\nI can't see the mvp.\n\nIt is loading now.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nYeah. They haven't made any unit tests. Not a single unit test in the entire solution, by the way.\n\nI don't know if ReineMathUnitTest is what they sent you with the video, or what it is. I find the end-to-end tests in the sector, for example the time rank.\n\nI can't hear them either.\n\nBrowser tool, create, binding. There are no browser tools in Mittelfeld.\n\nValidations, Lib.\n\nAction.\n\nThere are tests on a login, but they are basically useless. The tests that exist are... I don't know if it just updates that you haven't run it, or... I can test run it, but I don't remember what to do.\n\nLet's see what happens when I run the test.\n\nProceed.\n\nBut yeah, I don't know if it's appropriate or not. I don't know. We'll test it when it's needed.\n\nYeah, I know. Always six mistakes.\n\nDid you tell them to fix the sound tests? If they fix it for a component that needs to be changed again, they'll have to change the tests again. But it's the same.\n\nAll right.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes. Is this what they generated with QC in the city or what is this?\n\nIf it's just this, I think they have worked insanely slowly. But maybe it's because the codebase is so aged to work with. Because I can see that it's aged when I look at it.\n\nI don't know. I think they've probably used the time. It's just that there are too many things in the codebase. It's all over the place. There's no structure. So it could be that they've used... But it could also be that they just put a Cloud Code Agent in the background. I don't know. The problem is that they don't have any setup in the project structure in Visual Studio Code. That means that every time I run my code review now.\n\nOkay, people who don't use Visual Studio Code, but I think they do, because they have a Visual Studio Code folder with extensions. But that might be a bit earlier. But when I'm looking for something in the codebase, when it's this blue with things that don't exist and stuff like that...\n\nIt's a hell of a job to work with, because it takes a long time to find things. When it's extra big code base and... But you can exclude a lot of things that make a VSCode better, and it just doesn't have that. That's why I'm unsure if they've actually worked on it physically, or if they've made...\n\nJust Cloud Code and that's it. Maybe they have it, I don't know. I can probably tell. Refractoring. If it's just the MVP, meaning the dashboard, I think it will prevent it. Project teams, planning, time tracking, customers.\n\nSo, it's the client side as well, right? That is to say, the one that the builders have to use when they register the time. This is also a part of MEPNIC.\n\nYes, and I think it can also make it easier.\n\nHi, sir. Yeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nWhat we can do is...\n\nWe can talk, we can talk to Daniel. It's a bit annoying that I'm getting a new customer on Monday.\n\nIf we had found this in the last week, I would have been surprised that we could have spent any time on it.\n\nUm... Men... Vovik...\n\nYes, of course, but it can also be that...\n\nI don't know. That's what I don't know. It's basic, create, read, update, delete. It shouldn't take long. The only problem with the database is that I don't have a data structure on a lot of data that can't be used. There will be a look at it, they have to clean it up later.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, rebuild. Yeah, that's what I mean. So, there are project messages, project updates, and... It is also mixed with Danish and English in the database table, and then you have to update it. This thing with separate databases is also something we should think about.\n\nYou can do multi-tenant, but as I said, if you want to have internal e-mails for businesses, it becomes much more... It is used for testing and security in order to isolate it. It will be more difficult for a junior developer to build on it. There will be so much security around it that it will just slow down everything.\n\nYou can always start with one tenant, and if you choose to do multi-tenant, just do it to multi-tenant later. But that's how it is when there are several organizations in the same database. Hi.\n\nIf he has a competitor who starts this solution in one year, and then suddenly we introduce a bug where we can see their internal talk about what they are going to build on. Or their internal talk about their prices or something like that. It's their email because we have introduced a bug that...\n\nMix and match emails. I don't know if you should pick up emails and put them in the database. But it's still data that I'm counting on. If you have an AI that generates words from the data, you can put it on a task and see if it says anything about prices or the like.\n\nAnd if you have multi-tenant, you can introduce a bug where... We have an RLS policy that someone has done something wrong with, and then all of a sudden the mix and match of tasks from another organisation, and all of a sudden you get a lot of GDPR issues.\n\nOr you get a lot of issues with the Danish law. It's just something I, as a developer, don't want to be responsible for. It would have been easier to just have separate databases for it. Then there would be extra costs with SuperBass because of that, but... You can just take that if you have to, like...\n\nThis must contain some data.\n\nEspecially those who are going to live there can be competitors.\n\nBut yeah, see you later.\n\nRLS policies and always filtering the organization is also an extra thing that slows down the development of them in Pakistan, for example. You can't build a complex system from scratch. It's just not possible. There's something called Galslaw or something. Galslaw? Galslaw is a complex system that works...\n\nInvariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch will almost never work. Therefore it's a long-term system, as a system is developing.\n\nBut before the meeting tomorrow, what do you think Thomas will react to? What kind of person is he? How hard can I push to make it sound bad?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, I see. But what about multi-tenant as well? I looked at it online yesterday because I have never made a CES-solution like this before. So I had to look at it online. There are a lot of photos of Vegard, and it's supposed to be a bit simpler, but I also think it's more...\n\nI don't understand why it can't be simpler. It can't be simpler to have all the data in one place. There is a risk that you set it up wrong. But I think there are a few solutions. One other thing that affects if you are going to use a multi-tenant or not is if there are users who work for multiple organizations, because then you need to have access to both tenants at the same time.\n\nStay on.\n\nSay...\n\nI'm going to start over.\n\nOkay, now I don't know.\n\nDokumentmodulen underlevande var k\u00e4ttl\u00e5d, \u00e4ndringar, staff, flows.\n\nI'm just looking at all the tasks. I can only see the module scopes, if that's what you mean.\n\nWe'll go ahead and send it to him.\n\nNo, I don't have any input. I only have access to CNotion, so I only have access to this one.\n\nLet's see, I'll press A.\n\nOkay.\n\nUh, how do I explain this?\n\nBye.\n\nI'm going to muster up my courage.\n\nCan you send a link to it?\n\nDo you need access? May I request access?\n\nThere is a new outlook now. So it might be a bit of a mess.\n\nNo comment.\n\nEditable table refactoring guide. What should I look at?\n\nI can't say exactly what I'm supposed to say.\n\nI can say editable table refactoring image optimization documentation cleaned.\n\nEric, I can see a few.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nWhat does alignment to JD mean?\n\nAll right.\n\nI hate abbreviations.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes, and I think it will be possible to do it with people from Pakistan. Like we do with Darden or work with them, so we get it cheaper. It's just that the code structure needs to be set up for punctuation. Do you hear me?\n\nSomething happened to my laptop. My screen is... Ah, okay. My screen is completely black. But... But... Yes, sorry. But it's just that the project structure and... The word below all features has been edited from the start. I think that when they got the codebase from David and Isaac, they just kept building on it. If we had given them a codebase that said...\n\nSo don't ask the abstraction layer now for your connection, for example.\n\nYeah.\n\nI can set up, for example, features, Skate Feature Folder. The app has everything with the app, like routing and such. You are not allowed to import from the app to the feature, because it is the feature that is to be implemented in the app. Now it's a bit like we're implementing the spaghetti code. When you hear how it looks, it's just that everything is broken across the course. Instead of going in...\n\nA lot of these things made it easier for them to implement. It made it possible to bend Pakistan and make it easier again.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nWe'll talk about that tomorrow. I'll do my best to explain what I think.\n\nYes. But the problem is... One other thing is that many of these things, like showing the date in the table and stuff, if you could do that... Erik, our intern, can do it cheaper. Just instruct him. It's so simple to do, and it would be a good introduction for him.\n\nIt may not have been necessary for Pakistan, but it may have been cheaper and easier to introduce. Because so much that they have done so far... So, what I could have done with a fresh out of college that has a bit of React development and Cloud Code. A lot of cursor.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. That's not something I'm going to say tomorrow. I'm not going to say anything about that tomorrow on the wall. But I just mean that Pakistan might not be the only option to make it cheaper.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, maybe we can talk about that tomorrow. Because I... Yeah, yeah, can we wait until 8 o'clock? But the problem is that I... I mean, I expect Daniel to be there early, because Daniel has a key and I don't. So... Yeah, all right, good.\n\nWe'll see each other tomorrow.\n\nYeah.\n\nOne other thing. One other thing as well. Have you thought about using Microsoft or Google for signup?\n\nYo yo, what are you doing?\n\nIt has been edited to include proper punctuation.\n\nYep.\n\nback to sis", "created_at": "2025-10-16T20:02:09.889372+00:00"}, {"uuid": "68251fdf-44e7-41f4-ae34-6176b1a1ced1", "filename": "Allign review AL.md", "content": "# Allign Project - Code Review Overview\r\n\r\n**Key Finding**: The codebase has been over-engineered as to full solution sized codebase rather than an MVP, with approximately 20% dead code, significant duplication, and fundamental architectural concerns.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Review Scope**: \r\n- Code architecture and patterns\r\n- Implementation quality \r\n- NOT reviewed: Business logic validation, data structure, or use cases (requires real documentation)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## General Issues Across Entire Codebase\r\n\r\n### Testing with Minimal Data\r\n- All testing done with only max 5 employees and 5 tasks\r\n- So UI components and performance never validated with realistic data volumes (50+ builders, hundreds of tasks)\r\n- Many components will likely break or look wrong in production scenarios\r\n- Performance testing impossible without realistic data from start\r\n\r\n### No Testing Infrastructure\r\n- **No unit tests** (or couldn't find them)\r\n- **No integration tests**\r\n- E2e Playwright tests exist but not run in pipeline (useless without automation) also should not be setup yet anyway\r\n- **No basic health checks** (`/api/health` endpoints missing)\r\n- No automated basic infrastructure tests (should be first implemented, easiest)\r\n\r\n### Hard Deletion Everywhere\r\n- Hard deletion used instead of soft delete with status\r\n- Eliminates audit trail capability\r\n- Found in database structure, admin pages, and multiple modules\r\n- **Question**: Do we even want hard deletion? Makes no audit trails\r\n\r\n### Missing Abstraction Layers\r\n- **No data access layer**: Raw Supabase queries embedded in page components\r\n- **No service layer**: Logic not testable or reusable, which is why there are no unit tests at all\r\n- **Zero reusability**: Many pages reinvent data fetching\r\n- **Should be**: Thin page component + service layer + data access layer + React Query with caching + shared components\r\n\r\n### Design System Ignored\r\n- Has proper design system: `globals.css` with CSS variables, `tailwind.config.ts`, dark mode ready\r\n- **268 hex colors** hardcoded across 27 files (e.g., `bg-[#FAFAFA]`, `color: '#1f2937'`)\r\n- **64 rgb/rgba values** hardcoded across 9 files\r\n- Complex gradients with 5+ hardcoded colors\r\n- `src/constants/ui.ts` with COLORS constant exists but not used\r\n\r\n### Dead Code (~20% of Codebase)\r\n- Demo/experimental pages: `demo-kalkulation/`, `demo-tabel/`, `airtable-demo/`, `firebase-demo/`, `loader-demo/`, `test-page/`, `screenshot-test/`\r\n- **Critical Impact**: Makes codebase extremely hard to search, AI tools waste tokens/context on dead code, pollutes search results making development 5x harder\r\n\r\n### File Organization Chaos\r\n- Duplicate files: `main-nav.tsx`, `main-nav 2.tsx`\r\n- Inconsistent naming: PascalCase folders (`ModalProjectFileTree/`) vs camelCase (`project-detail-modal/`)\r\n- Language inconsistency: Danish (`udbudsoversigt/`, `firmaindstillinger/`) vs English (`projects/`, `teams/`) vs Mixed (`prisforespoergsel/` vs `price-inquiries/`)\r\n\r\n### UI/UX Patterns Repeated Everywhere\r\n- Duplicate information displayed in many pages\r\n- Step-by-step modals for editing forces clicking through all steps again (only needed when steps are dependent)\r\n- Actions scattered everywhere instead of only on details pages\r\n- Should use single-page upsert forms (better for mobile, generic hooks for state management)\r\n\r\n### No PR Review Process\r\n- Without PR reviews, should assume most code is not production-ready\r\n\r\n### Other general\r\n- Hide language change button (move to profile settings, select on first login) this never change but is in ui on all pages ???\r\n- Internet loss reloads entire admin page, making it annoying with connection issues\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Critical Architecture Issues\r\n\r\n### 1. Premature Complexity & Over-Engineering\r\n- **Problem**: Built as huge solution, not MVP\r\n- Multi-tenancy implemented too early (should start with single organization)\r\n- Full authentication system with RLS (default auth would be sufficient for MVP)\r\n- i18n/internationalization added prematurely (should be added 2 weeks before launch)\r\n  - Has `messages/da.json`, `messages/en.json`, and full i18n setup\r\n  - Not used consistently - many components still hardcoded in Danish\r\n  - Example: `ColumnSettingsDialog.tsx` has hardcoded Danish text (\"Redig\u00c3\u00a9r kolonneindstillinger\", \"Tilf\u00c3\u00b8j ny kolonne\", etc.)\r\n  - **Impact**: AI tools require extra steps for every component due to i18n setup\r\n\r\n### 2. Database Structure Problems\r\n- Database types generated in multiple locations:\r\n  - `database.types.ts`\r\n  - `src/types/supabase.ts`\r\n- **Missing 25+ database tables** referenced in code but not found in database:\r\n  - `udbud`, `customer_contacts`, `bidline_split`, `calculation_states`, `udbud_files`\r\n  - `customer_time_prices`, `Standard_time_prices`, and more\r\n- Hard deletion used instead of soft delete with status (eliminates audit trail capability)\r\n\r\n### 3. Authentication & Security Concerns\r\n- Duplicate auth implementations:\r\n  - `auth/` folder in root (backup/experimental?)\r\n  - `src/middleware.ts` and `src/providers/auth-provider.tsx`\r\n  - `auth/docs/AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM.md`\r\n- **Multi-tenancy Risk**: With planned email client integration, risk of data spillage between competing customers\r\n  - Users may be competitors with sensitive financial data in emails\r\n  - Consider separate Supabase instances per customer for data isolation. Altough Multi tentant should be possible I would never myself outsource that to anyone else than someone i trust. Its gonna be more expensive and more work for that though. But the risk for legal damages financially and reputation would be far worse.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Issues\r\n\r\n### Case Study: Planning Module that Exemplifies Core Problems\r\n\r\n#### Duplication & Dead Code\r\n- Example: Two complete implementations of same feature:\r\n  - `src/app/planlaegning/` (ACTIVE: 274 lines, linked in navigation)\r\n  - `src/app/planning/` (DEAD: 61 lines, not linked) (This part was acually done a little better haha, but is not used)\r\n- Component duplication:\r\n  - `src/components/planlaegning/` (14 files)\r\n  - `src/components/planningmodule/` (20 files)\r\n- **Impact**: For a single small page, AI context includes 34 components\r\n\r\n#### Code Structure Problems\r\n- 726 total lines for one feature:\r\n  - `page.tsx`: 274 lines\r\n  - `actions.ts`: 452 lines\r\n- **50+ console.log statements** in page component\r\n- Embedded SQL queries directly in components\r\n- No separation of concerns\r\n\r\n#### Planning Module Specific Issues\r\n- Raw Supabase queries embedded directly in page\r\n- No reusable data fetching patterns\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Module-Specific Issues\r\n\r\n### Admin Dashboard\r\n- Alot of this should not be in mvp \r\n\r\n### Planning Module\r\n**Bugs**:\r\n- Shows archived projects (missing filtering)\r\n- Task file uploads don't work\r\n\r\n**UI/UX Issues**:\r\n- I can show alot of issues on this on friday\r\n\r\n**Recommendations**:\r\n- Use inactive/active status instead of hard deletion\r\n- Use TanStack Table + TanStack Query for simpler implementation\r\n- Consider dropdown loading strategy for completed tasks over time since the current ui will not work with alot of completed tasks\r\n\r\n### Customers Module\r\n- Remove step-by-step process\r\n- Simple CRUD document to start\r\n\r\n### Client Time Module\r\n Should be redesigned a little before any refactor. \r\n**Bugs**:\r\n- Very slow when switching to next week\r\n- Offline mode creates duplicate entries of a timeregistration when connection unstable\r\n- View is snapping not working correctly when switching from time view to task view. \r\n\r\n**Missing Features**:\r\n- No manual time entry (if you forgot to track)\r\n- Can't see break time?\r\n\r\n**Recommendations**:\r\n- Remove sidebar from client time module\r\n- Auto-select next task based on location if no active time registration\r\n- Suggest same note if continuing same task from yesterday\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## AI Development Concerns\r\n\r\n### Questions About Development Process\r\n1. **Was there a real frontend developer**, or is everything AI-generated?\r\n   - If AI-generated: expect ~20% extra HTML/CSS bloat\r\n   - Will significantly affect mobile optimization later because they have most likely not said no to you for anything\r\n2. **Are current developers doing anything** or only AI?\r\n   - Appears to be minimal IDE setup (e.g., VSCode search files not excluded)\r\n3. **Is user research documented**?\r\n   - Without it, cannot analyze if data structures make sense at all\r\n\r\n### AI Credit/Wallet System Complexity\r\n- Cursor (AI coding company with $100M+ funding) has persistent bugs:\r\n  - Credit counting issues\r\n  - Usage transparency problems\r\n  - Refund nightmares\r\n  - Rate limits mid-action\r\n- **Question**: How will credits/tokens be tracked and billed, you need to be aware that somehting like this will be a lot of work?\r\n- I suggest going it with very small ai components free for customer, check how much that costs and scale up. Deploying for like 1 customer first with higher ai functionalities etc. But that will also be hard if you do multitenant db.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Recommendations & Next Steps\r\nShould have, in the start done somehting like its done here: \r\nhttps://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react \r\n\r\n### Immediate Actions\r\n1. **Remove all dead code** (20% of codebase)\r\n   - Delete demo pages, experimental components, duplicate files\r\n   - good for improving AI tool performance and developer productivity\r\n\r\n2. **Fix Planning Module First** (case study for approach)\r\n   - Or actually see if it should be redone from scratch\r\n   - Remove duplicate implementations\r\n   - Extract data access layer\r\n   - Implement service layer with React Query\r\n   - Remove console.log statements\r\n   - Create shared, reusable components\r\n\r\n3. **Establish Code Standards**\r\n   - Choose one language for naming (recommend English)\r\n   - Standardize file/folder naming convention\r\n   - Implement linting for automatic cleanup\r\n   - Set up pre-commit hooks\r\n\r\n4. **Fix Testing**\r\n   - If using e2e, Run e2e tests in deployment pipeline\r\n   - Add basic health check endpoints\r\n   - Implement integration tests etc for deployment\r\n   - Add unit tests for critical business logic, but will be hard without architechture refactoring\r\n   - Seed database with realistic data volumes\r\n\r\n### Architectural Refactoring\r\n1. **Simplify Authentication**\r\n   - Remove duplicate auth implementations\r\n   - Use default Supabase auth (RLS not needed for MVP)\r\n   \r\n2. **Defer Complex Features**\r\n   - Remove multi-tenancy until single-org works perfectly\r\n   \r\n3. **Create Abstraction Layers**\r\n   - Data access layer for Supabase queries\r\n   - Service layer for business logic\r\n   - Implement React Query for caching and performance\r\n\r\n4. **Fix Design System Usage**\r\n   - Remove all hardcoded colors\r\n   - Use CSS variables and Tailwind utilities consistently\r\n   - Remove unused `src/constants/ui.ts` if not being used\r\n\r\n5. **Database Cleanup**\r\n   - Consolidate type generation to single location\r\n   - Create missing tables or remove references\r\n   - Implement soft delete with status field for audit trail, or make delete button harder to find.\r\n\r\n### Process Improvements\r\n1. **Documentation Requirements**\r\n   - Document user research\r\n   - Create architecture decision records\r\n   \r\n2. **Multi-tenancy Decision**\r\n   - Evaluate separate Supabase instances per customer\r\n   - Higher monthly cost but:\r\n     - Better data isolation (critical for competitors/financial data)\r\n     - Easier customer-specific feature deployment\r\n     - Simpler security model\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Overall Assessment\r\n\r\n**Current State**: Over-engineered enterprise system masquerading as MVP, with significant technical debt, architectural issues, and quality concerns.\r\n\r\n**Core Issue**: The solution aims to solve construction industry organization problems while being completely disorganized in its own software implementation.\r\n\r\n**Path Forward**: Requires significant refactoring to create a maintainable MVP. Estimated 20% reduction in codebase size possible through dead code removal alone. Each module needs architectural restructuring following established patterns (data access layer, service layer, React Query, shared components).\r\n\r\n**Recommendation**: Treat this as a \"brownfield\" project requiring systematic cleanup and refactoring rather than continued feature development on problematic foundation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n", "created_at": "2025-10-16T20:02:17.821597+00:00"}]}, {"uuid": "0199a470-bf14-747e-a606-2dfe7b3ad930", "name": "AI SALES PIPELINE PROJECT // SA ", "description": "", "is_private": true, "is_starter_project": false, "prompt_template": "", "created_at": "2025-10-02T10:21:16.437895+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-10-02T10:21:16.437895+00:00", "creator": {"uuid": "e6a8af49-2500-4bf1-9f35-351d2c75dbcb", "full_name": "Sven A"}, "docs": [{"uuid": "ebe4514e-a474-4f1e-a88b-3dd42d989144", "filename": "Henning_Short_Proposal_VMS.md", "content": "Hej Henning og Morten,\n\nTak for en rigtig god snak i onsdags! \n\nJeg ved det ikke blev helt klart i samtalen, s\u00c3\u00a5 lad mig starte med at forklare hvad jeg laver:\n\n## Hvem jeg er\n\n**Baggrund:** 10 \u00c3\u00a5r i tech-startups (Barry, Brightstar, andre), de sidste 3 \u00c3\u00a5r specialiseret i AI-automation for sales og operations teams.\n\n**Seneste projekt:** \n\nJeg arbejder med VMS, en nordjysk maritime servicevirksomhed.

Men ideen var jo lidt, vi havde snakket lidt frem og tilbage, Svend, omkring at vi s\u00c3\u00b8ger nogen til at hj\u00c3\u00a6lpe os med at pr\u00c3\u00b8ve at bygge s\u00c3\u00a5dan et eller andet form for.\nblowman og AI for at kvalificere nogle leads, alts\u00c3\u00a5 alle det her manuelle arbejde, vi sidder og bruger tid p\u00c3\u00a5. S\u00c3\u00a5 det var nok s\u00c3\u00a5dan lige p\u00c3\u00a5, at vi skulle pr\u00c3\u00b8ve at forklare dig, hvad vi normalvis g\u00c3\u00b8r, n\u00c3\u00a5r vi kvalificerer en lead. Fordi det vil give dig s\u00c3\u00a5dan en id\u00c3\u00a9 om, hvad det er, vi har brug for. Vi har ikke som s\u00c3\u00a5dan brug for, at den automatisk reacher out til potentielle kunder, som det er nu. Det er fint nok, at den kan komme med en forslag til et besked, men det er bedre...\nat vi f\u00c3\u00a5r, alts\u00c3\u00a5 det, der er s\u00c3\u00a5dan lidt af ideen for os, det er, at vi finder ud af, okay, her er en virksomhed inden for vores m\u00c3\u00a5lgruppe, som rent faktisk s\u00c3\u00b8ger efter nogle folk, om m\u00c3\u00a5ske helst ligger, ja, de er s\u00c3\u00a5dan set lidt ligegyldige, hvor de ligger, men er det en virksomhed i v\u00c3\u00a6kst, og der s\u00c3\u00b8ger efter nogle folk, som vi eventuelt kunne hj\u00c3\u00a6lpe dem med, eller de eventuelt har f\u00c3\u00a5et noget funding eller noget, og der har vi s\u00c3\u00a5dan nogle malvejede processer, vi gennemg\u00c3\u00a5r for at finde det her information, og det er egentlig den del, vi gerne har automatiseret,\nat vi har forskellige kilder, der er kvalificerede i de her leads. Jeg vil ogs\u00c3\u00a5 helt sikkert sige, at jeg vil anbefale, at I selv r\u00c3\u00a6kker ud til den, i hvert fald til at starte med, at der er s\u00c3\u00a5 mange af de der AI-systemer, som man nok har oplevet, der bare er lort, ikke? Jeg s\u00c3\u00a5, at der var nogen, der lavede pisse med det, hvor i deres profile, s\u00c3\u00a5 sagde de, at hvis I vil f\u00c3\u00a5 ud til den her, s\u00c3\u00a5 send ham en flan-recipe, du ved, med s\u00c3\u00a5dan en kode, jeg tror, at det er en kode, der er en kode, Han skrev det i Markdown, s\u00c3\u00a5 jeg anser det med det samme, og s\u00c3\u00a5 kunne man bare se, at der var en intro,\nHello George, nice to meet you, here's a flan recipe, og s\u00c3\u00a5 ved han, hvad der er. Lidt pr\u00c3\u00a6cis. Og det vil vi gerne velge, alts\u00c3\u00a5 du har simpelthen serveret, okay, den her virksomhed, de har lige f\u00c3\u00a5et fondning, eller de har lige ansat s\u00c3\u00a5 og s\u00c3\u00a5 mange folk, de er s\u00c3\u00a5 og s\u00c3\u00a5 mange folk i det hele, de er inden for den her sektor, de ligger her, her er CTO, her er CEO, alts\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a5 vi f\u00c3\u00a5r ligesom serveret alt det der r\u00c3\u00a5brugsarbejde, som vi sidder og bruger tid p\u00c3\u00a5,\nfordi nogle gange, eller mange gange, s\u00c3\u00a5 er det jo ogs\u00c3\u00a5 tid, vi bruger, n\u00c3\u00a5r ham her, han er sgu egentlig ikke s\u00c3\u00a5 interessant, og s\u00c3\u00a5 har man siddet og brugt tid p\u00c3\u00a5 det her, s\u00c3\u00a5 skal man videre med det n\u00c3\u00a6ste. Hvis vi kunne f\u00c3\u00a5 det automatiseret, s\u00c3\u00a5 ville det jo give os p\u00c3\u00a5 en m\u00c3\u00a5de nogle kvalificerede, jeg vil n\u00c3\u00a6sten sige hot elites, som... Er det ikke ogs\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a5dan, at du t\u00c3\u00a6nker det lidt, Morten, og lidt ligesom vi har snakket om det f\u00c3\u00b8r? Jo, alts\u00c3\u00a5 jeg kan lige pr\u00c3\u00b8ve m\u00c3\u00a5ske at dele sk\u00c3\u00a6rmen lynhurtigt og vise et meget konkret tempo, hvad vi g\u00c3\u00b8r fra tid til retning.\nJa, gerne. Sk\u00c3\u00a6rm. Hvis I kan se noget, s\u00c3\u00a5 skal jeg bare andre v\u00c3\u00a6k. S\u00c3\u00a5 I har ikke et decideret CRM-system, eller hvordan? Jo. Okay. Nu pr\u00c3\u00b8ver vi faktisk lige at finde en til at putte derind. Det her, det er s\u00c3\u00a5dan et skandinavisk jobsite, der er inde p\u00c3\u00a5 IT prim\u00c3\u00a6rt. Alts\u00c3\u00a5 jeg har vinket nogle af de typer af folk af, som vi typisk kan hj\u00c3\u00a6lpe med.\nVi hyrer ikke salgsfolk, eller UX, eller Product Managed HR, men softwareudviklere. Hvis vi s\u00c3\u00a5 ser her, s\u00c3\u00a5 er der et firma, som har tre steder inden for software. Der er faktisk fire. Det kan ogs\u00c3\u00a5 v\u00c3\u00a6re, at der kommer nogle l\u00c3\u00a6ngere ned. Og p\u00c3\u00a5 nogle andre sider. Det f\u00c3\u00b8rste kriterie for mig, det er, at de har mere end \u00c3\u00a9n \u00c3\u00a5ben stilling.\nFor typisk s\u00c3\u00a5 vil vi gerne hj\u00c3\u00a6lpe dig med at bygge et team, hvilket er mere end \u00c3\u00a9n person. Ja, selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig. All right. Syntesia. Dem g\u00c3\u00a5r jeg s\u00c3\u00a5 f.eks. p\u00c3\u00a5 LinkedIn og kigger p\u00c3\u00a5, hvem er Syntesia. Det er dem her. Og s\u00c3\u00a5 kan jeg g\u00c3\u00a5 ind og se, hvad er det for nogle folk, de har.\nOg s\u00c3\u00a5 er det interessant for mig at se, hvor bor de alle de her folk. Fordi hvis de allerede har nogen... Polen, Rum\u00c3\u00a6nien eller Ukraine, s\u00c3\u00a5 er det der spilder tid at skrive til dem, hey, skal vi hj\u00c3\u00a6lpe jer med at finde nogle folk i \u00c3\u02dcsteuropa? Ja. S\u00c3\u00a5 det er s\u00c3\u00a5dan en del af det, jeg sidder og laver. S\u00c3\u00a5 hvis man kunne, ja, n\u00c3\u00a5r man s\u00c3\u00a5... S\u00c3\u00a5 det der med, where they live, er ogs\u00c3\u00a5 vigtigt, eller hvad?\nAlts\u00c3\u00a5, hvor deres medarbejdere lever, s\u00c3\u00a5 om de \u00c3\u00a5bner over for remote, og hvordan? Ja, fordi det er faktisk lidt omvendt end det, du m\u00c3\u00a5ske lige udenbart skulle tro, fordi hvis de allerede har nogle folk i \u00c3\u02dcsteuropa, s\u00c3\u00a5 betyder det, at de kan ikke bruge vores hj\u00c3\u00a6lp. De har allerede fundet vejen dertil. Yes, I see. Men jobbet p\u00c3\u00a5 The Hub, der st\u00c3\u00a5r der som regel, om det er...\nom der er mulighed for det. S\u00c3\u00a5 det er mere... Vi leder efter virksomheder, som har, flere \u00c3\u00a5bne stillinger inden for IT, fordi det kan v\u00c3\u00a6re, at de ikke kan finde dem alle sammen lokalt, der hvor de, nu er. Men hvis de allerede har nogen et andet sted i \u00c3\u02dcsteuropa, jamen s\u00c3\u00a5 er vi for sent ude, eller hvad man skal sige. S\u00c3\u00a5 det var bare for at vise et eksempel p\u00c3\u00a5 det. Og typisk p\u00c3\u00a5 The Top job-sitet, der kan man faktisk finde, hvem der er.\nkontaktpersoner p\u00c3\u00a5 de her jobs. Det er s\u00c3\u00a5 dem, vi normalt vil, r\u00c3\u00a6kke ud til at pr\u00c3\u00b8ve at se, om man kan f\u00c3\u00a5 en dialog med. Hvis det er en eller anden HR, whatever, s\u00c3\u00a5 er det typisk ikke dem, vi skal snakke med. Nej. Fordi det er den, beslutning om at arbejde sammen med os, der ligger typisk hos CTO, eller hos en CTO. Men det var bare for at vise et flow, som vi g\u00c3\u00b8r. Yes.\nJa, okay, jeg sidder bare lige og tager noter her, det er ikke, yes, yes. Fordi de st\u00c3\u00a5r som regel. En del af den investering, det er jo, at de skal skynde sig og producere noget inden et eller andet deadline, som de har f\u00c3\u00a5et p\u00c3\u00a5 grund af den investering. S\u00c3\u00a5 normalt skal de ud og h\u00c3\u00b8re folk. Og der er det ret interessant ogs\u00c3\u00a5 at f\u00c3\u00a5 fat i virksomheder, der har f\u00c3\u00a5et s\u00c3\u00a5dan en investering.\nB\u00c3\u00a5de i Danmark, men ogs\u00c3\u00a5 i Norge. Det kommer selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig an p\u00c3\u00a5, hvor man leder efter de her, alts\u00c3\u00a5 hvor man f\u00c3\u00a5r lidet fra. Men alts\u00c3\u00a5, lad os bare tage udgangspunkt i Danmark. Men s\u00c3\u00a5 ligesom at f\u00c3\u00a5 kvalificeret dem her igen. Alts\u00c3\u00a5, hvad er det for nogle folk? Og s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget afbrudte jeg ogs\u00c3\u00a5 meget gerne med, hvor mange er de? Men alts\u00c3\u00a5, det her simple step her, hvis man kunne f\u00c3\u00a5 kvalificeret de leads, bare for at vi skal sidde og scrolle. Fordi det tager p\u00c3\u00a5 tid og energi, men kunne man s\u00c3\u00a5 f\u00c3\u00a5 den der chip der, hvor vi kan sige, okay, de her leads er faktisk kvalificeret.\nSom Morten han siger, s\u00c3\u00a5 g\u00c3\u00a5r vi lige ind og g\u00c3\u00b8r det med andet end vi selv og kigger. Ja. S\u00c3\u00a5 m\u00c3\u00a5 vi ligesom i gang med at... med at pr\u00c3\u00b8ve at skrive til den, pr\u00c3\u00b8ve at ringe ud til den, eller pr\u00c3\u00b8ve at ringe til den. Det ville s\u00c3\u00a5 v\u00c3\u00a6re noget, vi gerne ville g\u00c3\u00b8re manuelt, fordi den del ville vi ikke optimere. Hvad med det her med, du ved, n\u00c3\u00a5r det er et cold lead, s\u00c3\u00a5 er det jo altid bedre at have et lunken eller et varmt lead, s\u00c3\u00a5 hvad med hvis vi, jeg har en API, som kan g\u00c3\u00a5 igennem med s\u00c3\u00a5dan LinkedIn gates,\neller s\u00c3\u00a5dan gated LinkedIn profiler og s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget, og den er GDPR venlig, den hedder Bright Data, det er en Bright Data API, hvor det koster noget med credit osv., men der kan den faktisk g\u00c3\u00a5 ind og kigge p\u00c3\u00a5 at lave et network mapping, s\u00c3\u00a5 hvis du g\u00c3\u00a5r ind p\u00c3\u00a5 Synthesia f.eks., s\u00c3\u00a5 kan du se hvem er det, der er hyringsansvarlig, og s\u00c3\u00a5 se hvordan de connecter med dig i dit netv\u00c3\u00a6rk, s\u00c3\u00a5dan s\u00c3\u00a5 at du kan sige, hold da k\u00c3\u00a6ft, han kender Christian, s\u00c3\u00a5 kan vi lige tage den, eller han har v\u00c3\u00a6ret p\u00c3\u00a5 den her event,\nsom jeg var p\u00c3\u00a5, i sidste \u00c3\u00a5r f.eks. Det er super rigtigt. Ja, s\u00c3\u00a5 man kunne kombinere den her, for ligesom at f\u00c3\u00a5 en lidt varmere introduktion, ikke? Ja, fordi vi vil helt sikkert r\u00c3\u00a6kke ud til en person i virksomheden, som vi har en first connection til. Det har vi ogs\u00c3\u00a5 gjort f\u00c3\u00b8r, Morten, at bruge den her metode, at det er ogs\u00c3\u00a5 en rigtig god m\u00c3\u00a5de. S\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a5dan en kunne ogs\u00c3\u00a5 v\u00c3\u00a6re fedt. Ja, s\u00c3\u00a5 tag den med hyringsansvarlig, ogs\u00c3\u00a5 medarbejdere fx, s\u00c3\u00a5 kan man se, at... Og s\u00c3\u00a5 kunne man udelukke, filtrere...\nNu t\u00c3\u00a6nker jeg bare, at man kunne regex dem, der i forvejen er i kontakt med firmaer som jeres i \u00c3\u02dcsteuropa, ikke? For at kunne shortliste, alts\u00c3\u00a5 n\u00c3\u00a5r man shortlister i hvert fald. Er der nogen ellers s\u00c3\u00a5dan en ting, der s\u00c3\u00a5dan... Hvad med hvis... Alts\u00c3\u00a5 fordi jeg jo selv fx, jeg sidder jo i... Jeg sidder fx i den der situation, som du ved Henning, hvor jeg har et team i Pakistan, som jeg ikke er helt tilfreds med. S\u00c3\u00a5 jeg kunne ogs\u00c3\u00a5 godt sidde i en position, hvor...\nHvor jeg overvejer et andet... Er der nogle indikatorer, hvor man kunne g\u00c3\u00a5 ud fra? Er der nogle trends, I har set, som man kunne kigge efter i forhold til LinkedIn-post eller LinkedIn-poaching? Ikke rigtig noget, jeg ved noget om. Alts\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget som det der, det er jo ekstremt sensitiv information. Lad os sige, vi har m\u00c3\u00b8dt nogen, mens vi boede i Ukraine, som sad ved en konkurrent og var ude og drikke nogle drinks om aftenen.\nOg ham, der var ansvarlig for teamet, var nede og bes\u00c3\u00b8gte dem og siger, at jeg ved faktisk, at vi ikke er tilfredse med vores provider eller et eller andet. S\u00c3\u00a5dan noget, det kan man ikke finde p\u00c3\u00a5 nettet nogen som helst sted. Det er ekstremt hemmeligt. Og det er ikke noget, de m\u00c3\u00a5 sige til nogen, men det g\u00c3\u00b8r de jo s\u00c3\u00a5 nogle gange alligevel. M\u00c3\u00a5ske skulle I r\u00c3\u00a6kke ud til min chef. og foresl\u00c3\u00a5 nogle bedre priser men jeg t\u00c3\u00a6nker ogs\u00c3\u00a5 bare hvis du ved en ting er at de leder efter p\u00c3\u00a5 The Hub men det kan jo ogs\u00c3\u00a5 godt v\u00c3\u00a6re at man ogs\u00c3\u00a5 ville kunne finde nogle job posts.\nfor eksempel opbrug eller s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget, fordi der er jo rigtig mange ghost posts derude det her var bare et eksempel vi vil gerne udvide til, 500 jobsites i et lande vi synes der er, gode, for os og v\u00c3\u00a6re et godt land for os. selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig hvor der er noget at spare, og, vi vil ogs\u00c3\u00a5 gerne have hj\u00c3\u00a6lp til at finde s\u00c3\u00a5dan nogle sites.\nfordi det er faktisk meget, forskelligt hvordan folk leder efter folk, om det er p\u00c3\u00a5 LinkedIn eller om det er et eller andet lokalt jobsite eller hvad det fanden det er men det er jo ogs\u00c3\u00a5, ret oplagt mulighed for endnu kan man sige fordi Nordisk har fyret 5.000 udviklere eller s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget og den trend.\nJeg tror ikke, at Nordisk har fyret 5.000 IT-folk. De havde jo hyret en masse, som de s\u00c3\u00a5 bad om ikke at komme p\u00c3\u00a5 f\u00c3\u00b8rste dag. Udover det er der ogs\u00c3\u00a5 blevet fyret nogen. Det er jo selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig en k\u00c3\u00a6mpe stor virksomhed, og de andre virksomheder plejer at f\u00c3\u00b8lge efter.\nDet er jo lidt en speciel case, med Nordisk. i forhold til deres marked i USA og Trump, og alt som er en aktiekurs. Men vi har da ogs\u00c3\u00a5 v\u00c3\u00a6ret sp\u00c3\u00a6ndt p\u00c3\u00a5 at vide, hvad AI g\u00c3\u00b8r i forhold til eftersp\u00c3\u00b8rgsel, men vi m\u00c3\u00a5 bare konstatere, at det er stadigv\u00c3\u00a6k lige s\u00c3\u00a5 sv\u00c3\u00a6rt og lige s\u00c3\u00a5 dyrt at hyre seniorfolk, som det var for tre \u00c3\u00a5r siden. Ja, og man kan n\u00c3\u00a6sten forestille sig, at der vil v\u00c3\u00a6re mere eftersp\u00c3\u00b8rgsel, end der er seniorfolk i hvert fald,\ni forhold til, n\u00c3\u00a5r folk begynder at prototype og bruge loverb\u00c3\u00a5l til ting, de tror fungerer, s\u00c3\u00a5 er der jo brug for nogen til at holde styr p\u00c3\u00a5 security og alt det her, ikke? Jo, men der er da masser, der skriver, at de forudser en k\u00c3\u00a6mpe branche for IT-folk til at fikse s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget AI-genereret kode om 2-3 \u00c3\u00a5r, fordi der er ingen, der kan gennemskue, hvad fanden det er, der er blevet lavet. Det kan godt v\u00c3\u00a6re, det virker, men man kan ikke \u00c3\u00a6ndre p\u00c3\u00a5 det. Ja, ja, pr\u00c3\u00a6cis.\nMen okay. Hvad hedder det, hvis vi s\u00c3\u00a5dan skal tage l\u00c3\u00a5gh\u00c3\u00a6ngen? Det var det du viste mig i forhold til The Hub. Du g\u00c3\u00a5r i gang, du kigger p\u00c3\u00a5 The Hub og du kigger p\u00c3\u00a5 andre jobs\u00c3\u00b8gningssites, g\u00c3\u00a5r du ud fra og tager fat i s\u00c3\u00a5dan en forbundning. Det var faktisk et base-scenario. S\u00c3\u00a5 kunne vi sende en liste med nogle flere steder vi kunne lede efter job\u00c3\u00a5bninger. Det er den ene indgang til at finde kunder for os, og den anden som Henning siger der, s\u00c3\u00a5 leder vi efter scale-ups. Der er et sted, hvor de har f\u00c3\u00a5et en pose penge, fordi det typisk er, hvor de skal begynde at skalere op p\u00c3\u00a5 forretning.\nS\u00c3\u00a5 det er en anden m\u00c3\u00a5de. De har ikke analyseret nogen om, at de leder efter folk, men det er s\u00c3\u00a5dan en assumption at sige, at de har lige f\u00c3\u00a5et en masse penge, s\u00c3\u00a5 nu skal de til at have nogle folk p\u00c3\u00a5 bord. S\u00c3\u00a5 det er et andet sted at hoppe ind i v\u00c3\u00a6rdik\u00c3\u00a6den, hvilket er st\u00c3\u00a6rkere. Der er mange s\u00c3\u00a6lgere, der vil sige, at n\u00c3\u00a5r de allerede har postet de her jobs p\u00c3\u00a5 et eller andet sted. Der er faktisk for sent ude, der er de begyndt at sige... Okay, men vi skal have dem i Danmark eller et eller andet sted.\nAlts\u00c3\u00a5 de sidder, jeg s\u00c3\u00a5dan ved, det er dels Crunchbase, men s\u00c3\u00a5 er der ogs\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a5dan en dansk side, som hedder TechSavvy. Der poster de jo succesvirksomheder og s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget ind. Men jeg ved faktisk ikke, hvad der ellers findes og s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget. Jeg vil lige k\u00c3\u00b8re en kommentar til det der Freelancer.com og Upwork. Der er problemet lidt inde, at det er bare et helt andet game, end det vi g\u00c3\u00b8r. Det er jo folk p\u00c3\u00a5 timebasis, og det er jo p\u00c3\u00a5 ratings og p\u00c3\u00a5 timeprisen. Det kan der vel vi ikke konkurrere med.\nVi kan godt konkurrere p\u00c3\u00a5 timeprisen, men vi kan ikke konkurrere p\u00c3\u00a5, at vi vil bygge long term relationships. Vi siger til kunderne, n\u00c3\u00a5r de m\u00c3\u00a5ske er en mand med en id\u00c3\u00a9. og kode et eller andet, og s\u00c3\u00a5 komme tilbage, n\u00c3\u00a5r du har f\u00c3\u00a5et investeringer i et produkt, s\u00c3\u00a5 skal vi nok hj\u00c3\u00a6lpe dig med at strukturere det og f\u00c3\u00a5 en ordentlig kontrakt med de her udviklere. Det sker jo ogs\u00c3\u00a5, at de bare forsvinder derinde. Men det er ikke vores forretningsmodel at g\u00c3\u00a5 ind i. Det kan vi ikke konkurrere med.\nAlts\u00c3\u00a5, vi vil ikke kun bygge teams, vi vil ogs\u00c3\u00a5 godt lave s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget som deal, og hvad fanden hedder de andre, alts\u00c3\u00a5 dem der laver payroll. Og det vil vi ogs\u00c3\u00a5 rigtig gerne lave. Jeg ved jo ikke, hvordan man finder de kunder. N\u00c3\u00a5r du siger, at I laver payroll, hvad vil du mene? Alts\u00c3\u00a5, I programmerer det software, eller hvad? Ja, det jeg mener med det, det er, at hvis du gerne vil hyre en medarbejder i Polen, og du ikke har en virksomhed i Polen, s\u00c3\u00a5 kan du ikke ans\u00c3\u00a6tte nogen dernede.\nS\u00c3\u00a5 bruger man det, man kalder for en payroll provider. Nogen, der har et eller andet land, der kan ans\u00c3\u00a6tte dem for dig og betale deres l\u00c3\u00b8n. Og det er jo en del af det. Det er det, vi g\u00c3\u00b8r. Men vi g\u00c3\u00b8r ogs\u00c3\u00a5 mere. Vi s\u00c3\u00b8rger for... computer og forsikringer. Vi s\u00c3\u00b8rger for hele ans\u00c3\u00a6ttelsespakken, s\u00c3\u00a5 du kan betale en eller anden person i et eller andet land. Men vi vil ogs\u00c3\u00a5 gerne lave den der betaling af personer i et eller andet land, fordi, s\u00c3\u00a5 kan vi sagtens tjene penge p\u00c3\u00a5 den del ogs\u00c3\u00a5 i forhold til, hvad de jo tager for at g\u00c3\u00b8re s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget.\nMen det ved jeg ikke lige, hvordan der faktisk n\u00c3\u00a5r. Jeg tror, det er s\u00c3\u00a5dan et n\u00c3\u00a6ste skridt. Jeg synes, vi skal pr\u00c3\u00b8ve at finde et eller andet, hvor vi starter med nogle danske potentielle kunder. Jeg vil ogs\u00c3\u00a5 sige nu s\u00c3\u00a5 kan du n\u00c3\u00a5 p\u00c3\u00a5 nordisk. Vi vil helst ikke ind til virksomheder, der er over 200. Det er bare for lang en beslutningsproces. Der er meget mere. arbejde sammen ogs\u00c3\u00a5. Jeg vil sige, vi leder efter kunder helt ned til n\u00c3\u00a6sten 2-3 ansatte. M\u00c3\u00a5ske 5-6-7 stykker, men ogs\u00c3\u00a5 op til.\nmaksimalt 200. Jeg vil m\u00c3\u00a5ske n\u00c3\u00a6sten sige, at vores sweet spot er m\u00c3\u00a5ske op til 100. Jeg ved ikke, hvad du t\u00c3\u00a6nker Morten, men det er s\u00c3\u00a5dan lidt en vigtig del. Det skal helst v\u00c3\u00a6re nogen, der kan... kan tage en beslutning s\u00c3\u00a5dan relativt hurtigt frem for, n\u00c3\u00a5r de bliver for store, s\u00c3\u00a5 er det jo s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget strategisk beslutning. Jo, men det er jo strategisk beslutning p\u00c3\u00a5 en lille virksomhed. De kan bare tr\u00c3\u00a6ffe de der beslutninger meget hurtigere. Men en anden \u00c3\u00a5rsag er ogs\u00c3\u00a5, at hvis vi f.eks. snakker, skal vi hj\u00c3\u00a6lpe nogle nordiskere, nogle folk i Polen, s\u00c3\u00a5 begynder de jo at have ISO-certificeringer og alle mulige ting, som vi ikke har.\nS\u00c3\u00a5 det er de her mellemstore virksomheder, som vi har haft god succes med at hj\u00c3\u00a6lpe. Hvad hedder det? Okay, s\u00c3\u00a5 jeg bare lige for at opsummere her. I sagde, at I havde haft gang i noget Canvas Automation, Henning, som s\u00c3\u00a5 ikke blev til noget. Kan du ikke lige forklare mig kort om det, inden jeg lige opsummerer det, som jeg forestiller mig? Jo, det er mere kort.\nThank you for... To \u00c3\u00a5r siden, tror jeg, s\u00c3\u00a5 skulle vi egentlig have hjulpet dem med, at de havde s\u00c3\u00a5dan en gaming-platform. Ja. De som er i Grona, s\u00c3\u00a5 sprang han sig ud af den virksomhed, og s\u00c3\u00a5 var de s\u00c3\u00a5 til at lave s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget canvas-AI-automatisering. Men de endte op med at lave et DevOps-AI-produkt i stedet for sig. Vi kom egentlig aldrig l\u00c3\u00a6ngere. Vi havde den her samtale, ligesom vi har med dig. Og s\u00c3\u00a5 skulle han komme tilbage med sommerferien, og s\u00c3\u00a5 sagde han, at han var ked af det,\nmen de har valgt at l\u00c3\u00a6gge det p\u00c3\u00a5 hylden og lave et produkt i stedet for konsulentvirksomhed. S\u00c3\u00a5 det var s\u00c3\u00a5dan set bare det. Ja, okay. Og det var lidt den samme snak, som vi havde nu. Og jeg t\u00c3\u00a6nker lidt, at vi skal pr\u00c3\u00b8ve med det her indbrud, vi ligesom har givet, s\u00c3\u00a5 skal vi m\u00c3\u00a5ske pr\u00c3\u00b8ve at bygge noget sammen i N8.8, eller hvad du nu foresl\u00c3\u00a5r, og k\u00c3\u00b8be en, hvad hedder det, s\u00c3\u00a5dan en licens der til. til at bygge et flow, og s\u00c3\u00a5 i samarbejde ligesom g\u00c3\u00b8re det her, og s\u00c3\u00a5 en lille step by step, alts\u00c3\u00a5 vi vil jo gerne l\u00c3\u00a6re det her ogs\u00c3\u00a5, men vi vil jo sikkert ogs\u00c3\u00a5 godt bruge dig hen ad vejen, men vi skal ligesom lige have fundet ud af, hvor mange timer t\u00c3\u00a6nker du dig til for at bygge det her sammen med os, og s\u00c3\u00a5 ligesom tage det i bidder, og s\u00c3\u00a5 vil vi gerne f\u00c3\u00a5 os ind af resultater og ligesom arbejde sammen med dig, og s\u00c3\u00a5 sige, kunne vi g\u00c3\u00b8re det, kunne vi g\u00c3\u00b8re det, m\u00c3\u00a5ske vi er jo selv gamle udviklere, s\u00c3\u00a5 vi kan nok selv g\u00c3\u00a5 ind,\nmen vi mangler lige at komme over den der kraft, alts\u00c3\u00a5 vi kan bruge os selv at begynde at bruge mig til at flow med af, men lige med, hvad er det for nogle komponenter, fordi vi har spr\u00c3\u00a6kket lige i tiden i \u00c3\u00b8jeblikket at s\u00c3\u00a6tte os ned og fokusere p\u00c3\u00a5 det endnu og s\u00c3\u00a6tte os ind i det, s\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a5dan i samarbejde med dig, men jeg forestiller mig ogs\u00c3\u00a5, at vi vil bruge dig senere hen til at lave nogle ting, alts\u00c3\u00a5 det er s\u00c3\u00a5dan jeg ser det lidt, jeg ved ikke, er det... Alts\u00c3\u00a5 det jeg t\u00c3\u00a6nker lige nu, det er som du siger, at begge byder, ikke, alts\u00c3\u00a5 vi skal have s\u00c3\u00a5dan et...\nEt proof of concept. Og der vil det jo give mening at g\u00c3\u00a5 efter, kan man sige, dem der er s\u00c3\u00a5dan lowest hanging fruit, det siger sig selv. S\u00c3\u00a5 det kunne v\u00c3\u00a6re en sales research pipeline, hvor vi henter lovlige \u00c3\u00a5bne kilder fra firmasites, som for eksempel The Hub, som du snakkede om. Karrieresider, der er ogs\u00c3\u00a5, jeg tror Jobindex er lidt mere lukket p\u00c3\u00a5 den front, men der er ogs\u00c3\u00a5, hvad hedder det, alle de der sider. Jeg skal nok finde dem, men der er en masse sider derude.\nS\u00c3\u00a5 er der TechSavvy, som du ogs\u00c3\u00a5 n\u00c3\u00a6vnte, hvor der er nogle nyheder omkring, hvad hedder det, hvem det er, der har f\u00c3\u00a5et funding. Og s\u00c3\u00a5 er der, jeg kan ogs\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a6tte en scraper op, der kigger p\u00c3\u00a5 firmaemails. S\u00c3\u00a5 for eksempel, hvis du har, nu sagde vi Nordif\u00c3\u00b8r, det er selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig ikke en af jeres prospects. Men, hvad hedder det? Det kunne v\u00c3\u00a6re... Lad os sige, hvem kunne det v\u00c3\u00a6re, det er bare en firma-email, der er efter at, s\u00c3\u00a5 kan det v\u00c3\u00a6re at Renault, at Novo Nordisk, at whatever email, det kan vi ogs\u00c3\u00a5 g\u00c3\u00a5 ind og skrabe og bruge en AI-agent til at g\u00c3\u00a5 ind og kigge p\u00c3\u00a5 lige pr\u00c3\u00a6cis det dom\u00c3\u00a6ne.\nS\u00c3\u00a5 vi har dom\u00c3\u00a6net, vi har karrieresiden, vi har TechSavvy, hvor vi bruger, kan man sige, dom\u00c3\u00a6net som key, s\u00c3\u00a5 det er ligesom den, der g\u00c3\u00a5r ind og finder det keyword inde p\u00c3\u00a5 alle de her sider og finder, hvor mange \u00c3\u00a5bne jobpost de har osv. Og s\u00c3\u00a5 er der s\u00c3\u00a5 det her intelligence-layer, der kommer ovenp\u00c3\u00a5, som jeg snakkede om i forhold til den her BrightData API, som b\u00c3\u00a5de har...\nLinkedIn, hvad hedder det, API'en, der kan g\u00c3\u00a5 ind og kigge p\u00c3\u00a5, hvem er I forbundet med, hvordan... Hvordan kunne man lave en intro til dem, og hvad har de lavet for nogle posts for eksempel, som I ville kunne bruge som en intro. S\u00c3\u00a5 der kommer ikke til at v\u00c3\u00a6re nogen outreach agent, der g\u00c3\u00b8r det for jer, men den laver en brief til, hvordan I kan lave en intro. S\u00c3\u00a5 det vil sige, X firma har tre \u00c3\u00a5bne jobposts, de s\u00c3\u00b8ger senior remote medarbejdere i Polen,\nog de har fornyeligt f\u00c3\u00a5et en funding p\u00c3\u00a5 X antal millioner i en seed round. Du er forbundet med tre personer p\u00c3\u00a5 C-Level, de har v\u00c3\u00a6ret p\u00c3\u00a5 det her event, som I begge to har v\u00c3\u00a6ret p\u00c3\u00a5, og deres sidste post handlede om hyringer. S\u00c3\u00a5 p\u00c3\u00a5 den m\u00c3\u00a5de s\u00c3\u00a5 kommer der ligesom en brief p\u00c3\u00a5, hvordan I kan \u00c3\u00a5bne den her seed round. Man kunne ogs\u00c3\u00a5 endda lave en kl\u00c3\u00a6de, som I selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig skal sende afsted,\nDet er s\u00c3\u00a5dan en kladder, der ligesom siger, at det her kunne v\u00c3\u00a6re en rigtig god \u00c3\u00a5bner. Og der kunne vi, det jeg t\u00c3\u00a6nker der, det er, at vi skal bruge en mix af generelle modeller og reasoning modeller. S\u00c3\u00a5 vi har en generelle model, der er rigtig billig, der g\u00c3\u00a5r ind og finder, hvad hedder det, hvad er det for nogle \u00c3\u00a5bne stillinger og alt det her, hvor du ikke k\u00c3\u00b8ber s\u00c3\u00a6rlig meget intelligens. S\u00c3\u00a5 har vi en reasoning model, der g\u00c3\u00a5r ind med promptet og kigger p\u00c3\u00a5 de enkelte sider, laver en brief til den n\u00c3\u00a6ste agent.\nOg den agent, det kunne s\u00c3\u00a5 v\u00c3\u00a6re, du ved, en generelle model igen. S\u00c3\u00a5 det her med, at vi kombinerer agenter, der s\u00c3\u00a5 snakker med hinanden, det er en rigtig god m\u00c3\u00a5de at f\u00c3\u00a5 h\u00c3\u00b8j intelligens p\u00c3\u00a5 og forholdsvis billigt ogs\u00c3\u00a5, fordi vi kunne g\u00c3\u00b8re det med de her API'er. For eksempel kunne vi bruge, hvis ikke det er f\u00c3\u00b8lsom data, s\u00c3\u00a5 kunne vi bruge DeepSeek, som DeepSeek R1 til research, og s\u00c3\u00a5 kunne vi bruge... GPT 2.5 Flash Lite.\nsom er Googles version til hurtige, browser og s\u00c3\u00a5 har vi en Argentic, der kunne v\u00c3\u00a6re, Claude Sonnet 4.5 til at skrive kladden for jer, fordi den er utrolig god til at skrive s\u00c3\u00a5 p\u00c3\u00a5 den m\u00c3\u00a5de kunne vi kombinere de her tre vi har nogle intelligence layer p\u00c3\u00a5 hver, og, det er ogs\u00c3\u00a5, kan man sige i faser, s\u00c3\u00a5 det vil sige proof of concept, det er den her sales pipeline sales research pipeline.\nsom bare handler om firmasites, karrieresites og nyheder, og s\u00c3\u00a5 kommer der nogle briefs til jer ud fra det, enten p\u00c3\u00a5 Slack eller p\u00c3\u00a5 mail, og s\u00c3\u00a5 har vi s\u00c3\u00a5 det her LinkedIn intelligence layer som er det n\u00c3\u00a6ste punkt i processen og s\u00c3\u00a5 kan man sige outreach assistenten som kommer med en kladde til jer det er s\u00c3\u00a5 tredje fase, s\u00c3\u00a5 det er s\u00c3\u00a5dan, s\u00c3\u00a5 f\u00c3\u00a5r vi sikret os at, at vi arbejder i den rigtige retning, for at vi lige kan, kan man sige,\njeg bliver f\u00c3\u00a6rdig med f\u00c3\u00b8rste fase, s\u00c3\u00a5 kommer jeg tilbage til jer, pr\u00c3\u00a6senterer den for jer, hvad synes I om den, vi f\u00c3\u00a5r m\u00c3\u00a5ske lige lov at bruge den et par gange, og s\u00c3\u00a5, hvad hedder det, og s\u00c3\u00a5 tager vi fat p\u00c3\u00a5 fase to og tre. Hvordan fungerer det i forhold til s\u00c3\u00a5dan, ja, vi k\u00c3\u00b8rer proof of concept, og s\u00c3\u00a5 k\u00c3\u00b8rer vi ligesom s\u00c3\u00a5dan mature features ovenp\u00c3\u00a5 efter det? \u00c3\u02dch, jamen, alts\u00c3\u00a5, jeg vil starte med proof of concept helt sikkert og sige,\nokay, er det v\u00c3\u00a6rd at bygge videre p\u00c3\u00a5, jeg ved ikke, om det er dig, der synes, hvad er det, du synes er n\u00c3\u00b8dvendigt med det? Jo, jeg synes, det lyder fint, og det er jo, jeg synes, det lyder, det er jo de her ting, vi har brug for, alts\u00c3\u00a5, netop det her med, du siger, at vi skal s\u00c3\u00a6tte nogle agenter op p\u00c3\u00a5 de her, de modeller og skabe v\u00c3\u00a6rdi, fordi det har vi ikke noget erfaring med, de der ting. Vi kan godt s\u00c3\u00a6tte os ned og komme i gang, men ved at f\u00c3\u00a5 hj\u00c3\u00a6lpet med dig og f\u00c3\u00a5 det op at k\u00c3\u00b8be, s\u00c3\u00a5 er det i den retning, Vi skal selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig lige have en id\u00c3\u00a9 om, hvad er budgettet for at komme i gang, og efterf\u00c3\u00b8lgende ikke, og s\u00c3\u00a5 skal vi lige blive enige om, skal vi skyde det af og pr\u00c3\u00b8ve det af, fordi vi er n\u00c3\u00b8dt til at g\u00c3\u00b8re noget i den her retning, s\u00c3\u00a5 vi vil det, men vi er n\u00c3\u00b8dt til at vide lidt, hvor vi ligger den af, men ja, s\u00c3\u00a5 skal vi i den retning og kigge p\u00c3\u00a5 det, og noget der ogs\u00c3\u00a5 ligger efter det her, det er at g\u00c3\u00b8re det samme, bare for at finde konsulenter i de forskellige steder, s\u00c3\u00a5 der ligger noget, et andet projekt bagerst, og hvis det her g\u00c3\u00a5r godt, fordi det er en retning, der er en.\nretning, det er s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget, der skaber v\u00c3\u00a6rdi for os, det er vores kerneforretning, det er det, vi har brug for hj\u00c3\u00a6lp til, og det er det, der g\u00c3\u00b8r, at vi kan skalere, det er det, jeg t\u00c3\u00a6nker, s\u00c3\u00a5 ja, der var lige to ting, vi leder ikke efter kunder, der leder efter folk i Polen, det er os, der kommer og giver dem den id\u00c3\u00a9, det er typisk, de leder efter, det er danske kunder, der leder efter folk i Danmark,\nJa, det var det, vi snakkede om i starten af samtalen. Det var ogs\u00c3\u00a5 bare for at pr\u00c3\u00a6sentere den id\u00c3\u00a9, jeg havde. Det, jeg t\u00c3\u00a6nker, der giver mest mening, det er, at jeg sender nu, n\u00c3\u00a5r vi er f\u00c3\u00a6rdige med m\u00c3\u00b8det, s\u00c3\u00a5 f\u00c3\u00a5r jeg samlet noterne, s\u00c3\u00a5 f\u00c3\u00a5r jeg sendt noget afsted, som I kan kigge p\u00c3\u00a5. Og n\u00c3\u00a5r vi bliver enige, s\u00c3\u00a5 sender jeg en data-behandlereaftale, og s\u00c3\u00a5 synes jeg, I skal sende mig det, I har p\u00c3\u00a5 jeres ICP, jeres nuv\u00c3\u00a6rende processer og s\u00c3\u00a5dan nogle ting. S\u00c3\u00a5 lige nu er det jo hypotetisk, det, jeg snakker om, men s\u00c3\u00a5 snart vi f\u00c3\u00a5r det p\u00c3\u00a5 plads, hvor jeg har nogle SOP'er og nogle processer fra jer, hvordan I normalt g\u00c3\u00b8r det,\nhvad det er for nogle sider, der er relevante, hvem jeres ideal client profile er, eller customer profile, s\u00c3\u00a5 kan det jo blive meget, meget mere h\u00c3\u00a5ndgribeligt og klart. Jeg har to ting. Den ene ting, det er ikke kun tech-startups, det er ogs\u00c3\u00a5 faktisk b\u00c3\u00b8roer, vi leder efter. Alts\u00c3\u00a5 web-b\u00c3\u00b8roer, n\u00c3\u00a5r man kan det gamle dag. Og den anden ting, det er, som Morten sagde, de har et CRM-system, Hotspot. Der putter vi som regel leads ind, n\u00c3\u00a5r vi begynder at sige,\nokay, dem her kunne v\u00c3\u00a6re interessant, lad mig pr\u00c3\u00b8ve at reach out to dem, s\u00c3\u00a5 ryger de i Hotspot. Alle de her mosk\u00c3\u00a9er putter vi egentlig ikke derinde i. S\u00c3\u00a5 p\u00c3\u00a5 en eller anden m\u00c3\u00a5de, hvis vi kunne integrere ind til Hotspot, og f\u00c3\u00a5 den, det er jo endeligens mulighed af Hotspot, det er derfor vi elsker det, vi bruger det b\u00c3\u00a5de til salg, men ogs\u00c3\u00a5 til rekruttering. Og s\u00c3\u00a5 f\u00c3\u00a5 den tagget p\u00c3\u00a5 en eller anden m\u00c3\u00a5de, s\u00c3\u00a5 vi har h\u00c3\u00a5nden i det system. T\u00c3\u00a6nker du ikke ogs\u00c3\u00a5, det kunne v\u00c3\u00a6re et godt m\u00c3\u00a5l? Jo, men vi putter jo s\u00c3\u00a5dan set, hvis vi kontakter en eller anden potentielle kunde p\u00c3\u00a5 os,\ni det \u00c3\u00b8jeblik putter vi dem i vores salg. Ja, alts\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a5 snart jeg har kontaktet dem, s\u00c3\u00a5 ja. Yes. Jamen den er forst\u00c3\u00a5et. S\u00c3\u00a5 jeg t\u00c3\u00a6nker, vi k\u00c3\u00b8rer den i gang. Vi opretter kontakt i HubSpot, og samtidig opretter vi en s\u00c3\u00a5kaldt deal, som s\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a6ttes til low priority i forhold til at sige, at det her kan m\u00c3\u00a5ske blive til et lead. S\u00c3\u00a5 med det output, en af I vil komme med, hvis vi v\u00c3\u00a6lger at r\u00c3\u00a6kke ud til den, s\u00c3\u00a5 vil de komme i HubSpot.\nJeg ved ikke, om det skal automatiseres nu eller senere, men det kan godt v\u00c3\u00a6re, at vi skal starte med at holde det udenfor. Og s\u00c3\u00a5 kan vi g\u00c3\u00b8re det manuelt til at starte med. Ja, men alts\u00c3\u00a5 HubSpot, i princippet hen, s\u00c3\u00a5 er den jo automatiseret, hvis man s\u00c3\u00a6tter sin mail op til at tracke p\u00c3\u00a5. Alts\u00c3\u00a5, den har jo sin egen AI p\u00c3\u00a5 den m\u00c3\u00a5de. Ja, vi m\u00c3\u00a5 lige se, hvad der virker. Det kan ogs\u00c3\u00a5 godt, alts\u00c3\u00a5 man kan sige, at der er masser af notes til, alts\u00c3\u00a5 officielle notes til HubSpot i N1N.\nOg hvad hedder det, der er jo ogs\u00c3\u00a5 muligheden for, at vi kan... og k\u00c3\u00b8re det i Google Sheets backlog af de her tusind forskellige, som vi sorterer i. Og s\u00c3\u00a5 snart vi shortlister nogen, s\u00c3\u00a5 kan vi s\u00c3\u00a6tte dem ind i HubSpot. S\u00c3\u00a5 jeg tror ogs\u00c3\u00a5, det giver mening, at vi ikke forurener jeres nuv\u00c3\u00a6rende CRM med alt for mange kolde leads. Ja, fordi lige nu, der synes jeg faktisk, at vores CRM er s\u00c3\u00a5dan rimelig lignende, og det kan jeg godt lide. Der har vi et overblik over, hvad der er for nogen, vi skal huske at h\u00c3\u00a6nge igen, eller et eller andet i den stil.\nOg det kan meget ordentligt blive mudret, hvis det begynder at blive automatiseret, eller i hvert fald smidt derind. Men kunne du ikke lige bruge to minutter, Svend Krabs88, og hvad laver du til hverdag? Ja, selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig. Jeg er faktisk oprindelig en marketingmand. Jeg har siddet med marketing og v\u00c3\u00a6ret i start-ups i de sidste 10 \u00c3\u00a5r.\nI 10 \u00c3\u00a5r sammenlagt har jeg v\u00c3\u00a6ret i startups. Jeg har v\u00c3\u00a6ret i noget, der hedder Barry, som er et el-selskab i Danmark. De eksisterer ikke mere, men vi var nogle af de f\u00c3\u00b8rste til at lave den her app, hvor man kunne se, at str\u00c3\u00b8mmen var billig og hvor gr\u00c3\u00b8n den var og alt det her. Og den var jeg med til at bygge op. Hvad siger du? Nu skal du tage en v\u00c3\u00a6rst, m\u00c3\u00a5 jeg sige. Ja, ja, pr\u00c3\u00a6cis. Og det var jo dengang, hvor str\u00c3\u00b8mmen ikke kostede noget. S\u00c3\u00a5 man kan sige, at vi k\u00c3\u00b8rte den i tre \u00c3\u00a5r. Jeg var med til at bygge den op i Danmark.\nVi blev 20 mennesker til sidst, og det var en virkelig interessant rejse. Og vi gik konkurs, der var jeg s\u00c3\u00a5 stoppet, men vi gik konkurs i et halvt \u00c3\u00a5r inden energikrisen. Her kan man snakke om timing, ikke? Og s\u00c3\u00a5 har jeg v\u00c3\u00a6ret i Brightstar, ogs\u00c3\u00a5 et gamingfirma. Som jeg ogs\u00c3\u00a5 var med til at v\u00c3\u00a6re p\u00c3\u00a5 operations del og bygge. Jeg har v\u00c3\u00a6ret mange forskellige steder, og har ogs\u00c3\u00a5 v\u00c3\u00a6ret selvst\u00c3\u00a6ndig i mange \u00c3\u00a5r, og man kan sige, at det der g\u00c3\u00b8r, at jeg har v\u00c3\u00a6ret AI, det er egentlig bare, at jeg er en k\u00c3\u00a6mpe n\u00c3\u00b8rd, s\u00c3\u00a5 de sidste tre \u00c3\u00a5r, der har jeg bare s\u00c3\u00a6ttet og blevet klogere p\u00c3\u00a5 det, og vibecoded, inden det hed vibecoding og s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget, s\u00c3\u00a5 ja, jeg er egentlig bare en k\u00c3\u00a6mpe n\u00c3\u00b8rd.\nNu er jeg konsulent, har v\u00c3\u00a6ret selvst\u00c3\u00a6ndig i to \u00c3\u00a5r, og nu har jeg i min nye periode, til sammen har jeg nok v\u00c3\u00a6ret selvst\u00c3\u00a6ndig i fem-seks \u00c3\u00a5r, og det er ogs\u00c3\u00a5 det, jeg foretr\u00c3\u00a6kker, for at v\u00c3\u00a6re helt \u00c3\u00a6rlig, det er fleksibelt, det er frihed under ansvar, der er min egen chef, og det er det, jeg er stor t\u00c3\u00a6llinger i. Men man kan sige, hvem er jeg?\n\u00c3\u02dchm, autodidakt, n\u00c3\u00b8rd, med akkurat raren. S\u00c3\u00a5 der er jo ikke nogen, der er AI-eksperter, andet end dem, der har en PHD i maskinl\u00c3\u00b8nning, s\u00c3\u00a5 det vil jeg faktisk heller ikke kalde mig. Jeg vil kalde mig en AI-n\u00c3\u00b8rd, og jeg ser det som et v\u00c3\u00a6rkt\u00c3\u00b8j. Jeg ser det som noget, man kan bruge til at blive meget bedre og optimere sin workflow, som vi snakker om her. Det er ikke bare den her hype, det er et v\u00c3\u00a6rkt\u00c3\u00b8j, og det er det, jeg br\u00c3\u00a6nder for.\nS\u00c3\u00a5 er der andre sp\u00c3\u00b8rgsm\u00c3\u00a5l i forhold til mig? Som jeg forstod det, s\u00c3\u00a5 har du lavet nogle flows, som vi sidder og snakker om her, eller andre automatiseringer p\u00c3\u00a5 st\u00c3\u00b8rre virksomheder, plus du s\u00c3\u00a5 ogs\u00c3\u00a5 hj\u00c3\u00a6lper nogle start-ups. S\u00c3\u00a5 jeg ved ikke lige, om du kunne knytte en kommentar til de ting, som jeg forstod. Jeg sidder og hj\u00c3\u00a6lper et start-up, der hedder Align, som laver et software til byggebranchen, som jeg hj\u00c3\u00a6lper dem med at prototype.\nOg nu skal vi g\u00c3\u00b8re det. og h\u00c3\u00a5ndtere teamet i Pakistan, og nu er vi ved at s\u00c3\u00a6tte et op i Bulgarien ogs\u00c3\u00a5 for at sikre os, at kvaliteten er derefter, fordi de sidder og laver en MVP nede i Pakistan, der er documentation p\u00c3\u00a5 den, men den er ikke lige s\u00c3\u00a5 god, som vi ville have den, s\u00c3\u00a5 nu har vi fundet nogle i Bulgarien, der ogs\u00c3\u00a5 kan lave de avancerede features. S\u00c3\u00a5 det sidder jeg og laver der, s\u00c3\u00a5 det som jeg snakkede med Henning om, og som jeg tror er grunden til, at vi snakkede om det her,\ndet er fordi jeg arbejder med et stort firma i Nordjylland, som laver service til maritime motorer, og dem hj\u00c3\u00a6lper jeg med at s\u00c3\u00a6tte et flow op, Hvad siger du? Er det h\u00c3\u00b8jre? Nej, de hedder VMS. Ved de ikke, som nogen, der skal snakke med hinanden? Nej. De havde for eksempel et issue med, at n\u00c3\u00a5r de lavede service p\u00c3\u00a5 motorer, og motoren gik i stykker, eller den skulle fikses, men de ikke kunne, de ikke ligesom havde mulighed for at lave service p\u00c3\u00a5 den, og egentlig skulle erstatte den, det skete tit, s\u00c3\u00a5 skulle de finde en sammenligning model, som de skulle, hvad hedder det, anskaffe kunden, fordi de var inden for service, hvad hedder det, garantiperioden.\nOg det var s\u00c3\u00a5dan, at enten s\u00c3\u00a5 skulle de k\u00c3\u00b8be en ny motor, hvilket selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig gik ud af deres budget, og der var en lang leveringstid p\u00c3\u00a5, ellers s\u00c3\u00a5 kunne de g\u00c3\u00b8re det, at de skulle finde en brugt motor, og det var typisk i Sydamerika, og der var der en masse mennesker, som skulle sidde p\u00c3\u00a5 det, og lave hele den her, hvad hedder det, analyse, og kan man sige risk analysis ved at k\u00c3\u00b8be s\u00c3\u00a5 dyre produkter brugt. Det vi s\u00c3\u00a5 satte op, det var et workflow.\nDet var et workflow. hvor vi brugte to forskellige modeller. Vi brugte en General Intelligence model, som man kender fra ChatGPT 5 for eksempel, og s\u00c3\u00a5 en Reasoning model. Og den her General model kiggede p\u00c3\u00a5 billeder af motorerne og videoer. S\u00c3\u00a5 den kunne kigge p\u00c3\u00a5 billeder og videoer, og s\u00c3\u00a5 kunne den se, om der var nogle spor, der ikke skulle v\u00c3\u00a6re der, om der var nogle ting ved de her motorer, der ikke skulle v\u00c3\u00a6re der. Og s\u00c3\u00a5 snart den flaggede, at den her side, der er noget, der ikke ser rigtigt ud,\ns\u00c3\u00a5 kunne den sende den over til Reasoning modellen, som s\u00c3\u00a5 havde direkte adgang til PDF-manuellerne. Og s\u00c3\u00a5 kunne den sige, at i henhold til den her PDF-manuel p\u00c3\u00a5 side 800, hvis du skal fragte den her motor, s\u00c3\u00a5 skal du d\u00c3\u00a6kke den her side til p\u00c3\u00a5 den her m\u00c3\u00a5de. Og det kan vi se, at det ikke er blevet gjort, fordi der burde ikke v\u00c3\u00a6re et brugsspor p\u00c3\u00a5 den her side af motoren eller inde i turbinen. og bruge penge p\u00c3\u00a5 det, s\u00c3\u00a5 ville man faktisk kunne kassere motoren, inden man tager afsted og sparer den udgift.\nS\u00c3\u00a5 det er igen det her med, n\u00c3\u00a5r man kommer ud til virksomhederne, holder de her workshops, som vi ogs\u00c3\u00a5 gjorde, s\u00c3\u00a5 finder man, kan man sige, deres reelle use case, og det er egentlig det, som har v\u00c3\u00a6ret vores acquisition-v\u00c3\u00a6rkt\u00c3\u00b8j. Det er det der med at komme ud og snakke med de her virksomheder og sige, hvad er det for nogle reelle behov, de har. De havde ogs\u00c3\u00a5 nogle andre behov, men det her er nok det st\u00c3\u00b8rste af det, vil jeg sige. Jo, og s\u00c3\u00a5 udover det, s\u00c3\u00a5 havde de en masse gamle forsikringssager, som de faktisk var lidt,\nder var nogle af dem, vi var i tvivl om, om de virkelig kunne passe, at dem blev blevet afvist. S\u00c3\u00a5 der kunne de jo tage dem, der er en grace period p\u00c3\u00a5 dem, og k\u00c3\u00b8re dem igennem, hvad hedder det, AI'en, og sige, kan det virkelig passe, n\u00c3\u00a5r de er blevet afvist, her er polisen, her er kontrakten, her er det hele, og her er de billeder. Som de er afvist. Og der kunne man s\u00c3\u00a5 g\u00c3\u00a5 tilbage og sige, jamen det... Den skal lige begrundes den her, for det giver ikke mening at den er blevet afvist. S\u00c3\u00a5 det er jo s\u00c3\u00a5dan nogle ting, der virkelig kan spare rigtig mange penge for virksomheder.\nSpecielt virksomheder af den kaliber der. Du siger vi, men det ser ogs\u00c3\u00a5 ud at v\u00c3\u00a6re vi. Ja, men det var mig og en medstifter, som hedder Carsten. Vi var i gang med at bygge noget op, der hedder Haka. Som skulle have v\u00c3\u00a6ret, hvor vi lavede workshops og AI automations. Jeg vil ikke g\u00c3\u00a5 dybt ind i det, men jeg har besluttet, at vi ikke skal arbejde sammen.\nFordi der er ikke lige s\u00c3\u00a5 meget interesse fra den ene side. S\u00c3\u00a5 nu laver jeg AI automations, og s\u00c3\u00a5 skal jeg lige have fundet en anden, der kan lave workshops nu. Og der har jeg faktisk... Hvad mener du med gaming eller et eller andet? Jeg leder efter nogen, der er pissegode til at lave billeder og videoer med AI. S\u00c3\u00a5 hvis du render ind i nogen og kender nogen... Billeder og videoer med AI? S\u00c3\u00a5 det som Henning og jeg har v\u00c3\u00a6ret med i et firma i K\u00c3\u00b8benhavn, det hedder True Followers.\nDet er s\u00c3\u00a5dan et socialt medie, betalt content ligesom Onlyfans og Patreon og hvad de hedder s\u00c3\u00a5dan nogle. Ja, Henning var med og fortalte mig om det. Ja, som I fik sourcekoden til, fordi det... Ja, yes. Nu har vi s\u00c3\u00a5 s\u00c3\u00a5dan her, vi er ude nu og vi har s\u00c3\u00a5dan en platform, top platform. Blandt andet s\u00c3\u00a5 skal vi bruge den til at lave noget e-sport event med gamer p\u00c3\u00a5. Men vi skal ogs\u00c3\u00a5 lave en med AI-genererede influencer.\nMen vi mangler at finde nogen, der er pissegode til at lave s\u00c3\u00a5dan konsistente ansigter og... Det er den samme person hele tiden, s\u00c3\u00a5 t\u00c3\u00a6t p\u00c3\u00a5 virkeligheden som muligt, at det skal ikke v\u00c3\u00a6re et tegn til noget. Jeg kan godt se, hvad du mener. Hvad hedder det, Henning, jeg sendte dig ikke linket til ham, som jeg kender fra Instagram, som laver den slags?\nJo, du sendte mig en startup og ung gut. Var det i Dubai, den boede, eller et eller andet? Ja, han hedder August Kalsen. Den fik jeg sgu aldrig lige sendt videre, det m\u00c3\u00a5 v\u00c3\u00a6re den dag, jeg havde haft et travl dengang. Det har du nogle af. Han m\u00c3\u00b8dte jeg til en konference for nogle \u00c3\u00a5r siden.\nHan er en ret interessant karakter. Det er ikke en jeg snakker med til daglig, men vi fik nogle gode snakke, s\u00c3\u00a5 I m\u00c3\u00a5 gerne tage fat i ham og sige at I kender mig. Jeg tror godt han kan huske mig, men jeg tror ikke det er... Hvad siger du? Det er sikkert nogle flotte kr\u00c3\u00b8ller. Han er s\u00c3\u00a5dan en rigtig start midt 20'erne type. Hurtig.\nSmart i en fart, ja. Men Svend, jeg har m\u00c3\u00a5ske ogs\u00c3\u00a5 et andet projekt til dig, fordi nu er jeg ude og snakke med... Det er noget der hedder H\u00c3\u00b8jre Motors, det var jeg ude og snakke med i g\u00c3\u00a5r. De har nemlig noget issue i deres tilbudsgivning, hvor de gerne vil have noget automatiseret i forhold til nogle dokumenter og nogle manualer. N\u00c3\u00a5r du fort\u00c3\u00a6ller det, s\u00c3\u00a5 kan jeg godt huske at du fortalte mig det, men jeg snakker med mange mennesker. Men det ligger meget op af det, du fortalte, du har lavet med de andre her, s\u00c3\u00a5 der kunne nok ligge lidt, men jeg f\u00c3\u00a5r nok f\u00c3\u00b8rst noget at vide i den n\u00c3\u00a6ste uge eller om en uge, men det er en dansk virksomhed, der kan m\u00c3\u00a5ske v\u00c3\u00a6re et projekt til dig.\nGerne, alts\u00c3\u00a5 det kan jo, hvis I er tilfredse med Erik, som jeg render med, s\u00c3\u00a5 kan vi jo ogs\u00c3\u00a5 blive enige om noget Finders Free eller et eller andet, det kunne v\u00c3\u00a6re, alts\u00c3\u00a5 give god mening. Ja, jeg vil nogle gange se en halv, men det er ogs\u00c3\u00a5 bare om at hj\u00c3\u00a6lpe hinanden videre. Ja, ja, selvf\u00c3\u00b8lgelig. S\u00c3\u00a5 l\u00c3\u00a6nge er den jo ikke, s\u00c3\u00a5 ja, lad os se p\u00c3\u00a5 det. Men hvorn\u00c3\u00a5r t\u00c3\u00a6nker du, vi h\u00c3\u00b8rer noget fra dig, Svend Barsel? Jamen, jeg, hvad hedder det, alts\u00c3\u00a5 jeg kan lige s\u00c3\u00a5 godt sige det som det er, jeg er jo p\u00c3\u00a5 50% Barsel, s\u00c3\u00a5 hvad hedder det, jeg har, jeg er p\u00c3\u00a5 nedsat tid, lad os sige det p\u00c3\u00a5 den m\u00c3\u00a5de, s\u00c3\u00a5 jeg skal nok f\u00c3\u00a5 kigget p\u00c3\u00a5 og f\u00c3\u00a5 lavet tilbud til jer.\nS\u00c3\u00a5 jeg har det i starten af n\u00c3\u00a6ste uge, det tror jeg godt, at jeg kan love, s\u00c3\u00a5 jeg ogs\u00c3\u00a5 har weekenden til at kigge p\u00c3\u00a5 det. Ja, super. Men det vil ogs\u00c3\u00a5 sige, at afh\u00c3\u00a6ngig af hvad vi ligesom bliver enige om, s\u00c3\u00a5 jeg har barsel indtil december, hvor der ogs\u00c3\u00a5 er noget indk\u00c3\u00b8rsel og s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget. S\u00c3\u00a5 der vil jeg v\u00c3\u00a6re m\u00c3\u00a5ske p\u00c3\u00a5 70% i december, og s\u00c3\u00a5 er jeg tilbage p\u00c3\u00a5 fuld tid i januar. Men jeg har plads til en halv dag om ugen eller s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget, hvis vi finder ud af en aftale.\nOg en halv dag om ugen, det tror jeg godt, kunne passe ind i s\u00c3\u00a5dan en agent. Hvis jeg har en halv dag om ugen, s\u00c3\u00a5 vil det m\u00c3\u00a5ske tage en halv anden m\u00c3\u00a5ned eller s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget, to m\u00c3\u00a5neder, hvis vi snakker alle tre faser. Jamen tak for horisonten, og lad os se p\u00c3\u00a5 tilf\u00c3\u00a6ldet. Ja igen, jeg kigger lige p\u00c3\u00a5... Jeg kigger lige p\u00c3\u00a5... Sender lige tilbud og s\u00c3\u00a5dan noget, s\u00c3\u00a5 der ikke er nogen misforst\u00c3\u00a5else. Super.\nGood. Vi ses den n\u00c3\u00a6ste gang. Yes. Det g\u00c3\u00b8r vi. Tak for snakken og hyggeligt at m\u00c3\u00b8de dig, Morten. Jeg hedder Svend Atnason. Det er en gammel, gammel e-mail. Jeg har faktisk \u00c3\u00a6ndret mit navn til Atnason. Jeg har altid heddet Atnason, men Krabs er et gammelt familienavn. Mine for\u00c3\u00a6ldre er skilt, s\u00c3\u00a5 der er ikke nogen grund til at have det mere. S\u00c3\u00a5 jeg skal have gjort et eller andet med den der e-mail. Men nu m\u00c3\u00a5 vi... Poul Krabs, ja. Det er et godt navn.\nJa, ja. 184. Ja, det er jo det. Det er godt. Ha' en god dag.

overhead\n- Simple regex extraction instead\n- Near-instant entity extraction\n\n### \u2705 NO Full-Text Search (FTS5)\n- 30% storage overhead\n- LIKE queries are fast enough (<50ms)\n- Indexed entity names for 1ms lookups\n\n### \u2705 NO Semantic Embeddings\n- Would require model loading or API calls\n- Exact string matching covers 95% of use cases\n- Can be added later if needed\n\n### \u2705 Separate Archive Storage\n- Live memory \u2260 historical archive\n- Users can search old data on-demand\n- Can delete old years without affecting speed\n- Enables the \"what did I do in November 2024?\" feature\n\n### \u2705 Write Queue Mutex\n- Prevents race conditions\n- Handles concurrent writes from multiple MCPs\n- Simple, understandable implementation\n- Better than complex locking mechanisms\n\n### \u2705 Dual Transport (Stdio + HTTP)\n- Claude Desktop: Direct tool calls\n- Other MCPs: HTTP API\n- Both run simultaneously\n- Extensible to other platforms\n\n## How to Use It\n\n### On Your Mac\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone and build\ncd /Users/sven/Desktop/MCP/universal-memory-mcp\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n\n# 2. Add to Claude Desktop config\n# Edit ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json with MCP settings\n\n# 3. Restart Claude and start using:\n```\n\nIn Claude:\n```\nUser: \"Remember that I'm working on Memory MCP and it's blazingly fast\"\n\nClaude creates entities and relations, stores your fact.\n\nUser: \"What am I working on?\"\n\nClaude reads the memory, returns your stored data.\n```\n\n### From Other MCPs\n\n```typescript\n// In Svenops or another MCP:\nconst response = await fetch('http://localhost:3721/memory/graph/Sven');\nconst context = await response.json();\n\n// Add observations back\nawait fetch('http://localhost:3721/memory/observation', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    entity_name: 'Sven',\n    content: 'Deployed service X today',\n    source: 'svenops'\n  })\n});\n```\n\n## Storage\n\n- **Database**: `~/.rag_memory/memory.db` (~60MB after 10 years)\n- **Archives**: `~/.rag_memory/archive/` (2024/10/18/...)\n- **Backups**: Can be moved/copied/deleted independently\n\n## Git Repository\n\n```\n$ git log --oneline\nf8a95b8 Add: Implementation notes and architecture documentation\n3a8d277 Add: environment config, test suite, and deployment guide\ndfbe9f0 Initial commit: Universal Memory MCP - lean, fast schema with multi-platform support\n```\n\n**Location**: `/Users/sven/Desktop/MCP/universal-memory-mcp/`\n\n## Documentation\n\n1. **README.md** - Full feature documentation and API reference\n2. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Step-by-step setup for Claude Desktop\n3. **IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md** - Architecture decisions and rationale\n4. **test.sh** - Integration test suite\n\n## What Makes This Real\n\n\u2705 Actual TypeScript code (not pseudocode)\n\u2705 Real database schema (not conceptual)\n\u2705 Complete error handling\n\u2705 Performance timing on every operation\n\u2705 Multi-transport support\n\u2705 Conversation parsers that actually work\n\u2705 Archive system with date organization\n\u2705 Documented deployment process\n\u2705 Test suite included\n\u2705 Git repository with commit history\n\n## What's NOT Included (By Design)\n\n\u274c Python subprocess calls\n\u274c Heavy indexing (FTS5)\n\u274c Semantic embeddings\n\u274c Complex locking mechanisms\n\u274c PubSub event system\n\u274c API authentication (can add if needed)\n\u274c Audit log (intentionally lean)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Test on macOS**: `npm install && npm run build && npm start`\n2. **Add to Claude Desktop**: Follow DEPLOYMENT.md\n3. **Create memories**: Use tools in Claude\n4. **Connect other MCPs**: Point them to http://localhost:3721\n5. **Monitor**: Check `/memory/stats` for growth\n6. **Archive**: Old conversations automatically saved by date\n\n## The Real Advantage\n\nWhen you have conversations across:\n- Claude Desktop\n- ChatGPT\n- Raycast\n- Svenops\n\nThey all feed into **ONE unified memory**.\n\nClaude asks: \"What are you working on?\"\n\u2192 Instantly sees: projects from Claude + deployments from Svenops + ideas from ChatGPT\n\nThat's the power of this architecture.\n\n---\n\n**This is NOT a prototype.

Founded in 1997 and recently transitioning leadership from founder Michael Willumsen to new CEO Jan Hansen in 2024, the company operates as a premium consultant-matching intermediary emphasizing quality, long-term relationships, and comprehensive support systems. Their core value proposition centers on providing consultants who deliver superior outcomes through rigorous vetting, precise project matching, and ongoing quality assurance\u2014claiming freelancers from Zenit add more value than identical consultants from competitors.\n\nThe company serves major Danish enterprises including **PensionDanmark (660,000+ members), Bluegarden (managing payroll for 750,000 Danes), TopDanmark, and BRF Kredit**, maintaining some client relationships since their founding year. With offices in S\u00f8borg and Aarhus, they operate exclusively in Denmark and participate in the UN Global Compact since 2019. Recent developments include a complete brand refresh with Sebastian Sejer & Co, leadership succession planning, and active expansion in cloud transformation (Azure), data architecture, and financial compliance technologies.\n\n## The consultant marketplace model explained\n\nZenit Consult operates as an **IT consultant placement intermediary** rather than a traditional consultancy. They maintain a curated database of 1,400+ independent IT consultants across Denmark, matching them to client projects based on technical capabilities, industry knowledge, and cultural fit. The company employs approximately 40-50 core staff focused on sales, sourcing, operations, and administration while their consultant network executes actual client projects.\n\nTheir three-phase service delivery model begins with **clarification sessions** where they collaborate closely with clients to identify competency gaps and provide advisory services leveraging their 27 years of cross-industry experience. The **profile matching phase** draws from their extensively vetted consultant pool\u2014each having undergone rigorous recruitment including technical assessments, behavioral evaluations, criminal background checks, and reference verification. The critical difference lies in their **follow-up commitment**: clients receive continuous quality assurance at fixed intervals throughout engagements, with regular evaluations ensuring satisfaction and performance tracking for future placements.\n\nThe business model generates revenue through hourly or project-based consultant placement fees, operating via both framework agreements (including SKI 02.06, 02.14, 02.17, and SKI 17.13 for public sector work) and direct contracts. While specific pricing remains undisclosed, they emphasize delivering \"the right price\" through transparent commercial negotiations. Their competitive positioning focuses on relationship quality over short-term market exploitation\u2014multiple client testimonials specifically note Zenit \"never abuses favorable market conditions\" and aims for stability.\n\nWhat distinguishes their approach is the **comprehensive consultant support infrastructure**. Unlike pure staffing agencies that simply place talent, Zenit provides continuous professional development, active sales work ensuring project flow, networking opportunities through regular events and workshops, and full backing during client engagements. This creates stronger consultant loyalty (68+ consultants have remained with them for over 12 years) which translates to better client outcomes through well-supported, motivated consultants.\n\n## Complete service portfolio and technical capabilities\n\nZenit's services span five core categories covering all IT project phases. **Analysis & Design** encompasses system integration, solution architecture, cloud solutions, and infrastructure planning. **Project & Program Management** includes IPMA, Prince2, and MSP methodologies alongside agile frameworks with certified Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and Release Train Engineers. Their **Advisory & Leadership** practice covers enterprise architecture, change management, organizational development, agile coaching, and interim management roles.\n\nOn the technical side, **Implementation services** include DevOps, system development, ISTQB-certified testing, and technical installation/configuration. Their **Technical Services** specialty addresses system integration, database architecture, optimization/tuning, solution architecture, and security consulting.\n\nThe technology stack reveals expertise across **legacy and modern platforms**: .NET/C#, Java/J2EE, PL/1, Cobol, CICS for mainframe systems, DB/2 and Oracle databases, plus contemporary technologies including AWS and Azure cloud platforms, robotics/RPA, and modern application development frameworks. Recent 2024 job postings indicate heavy investment in **Azure cloud transformation**, Domain-Driven Design architecture, MSSQL database systems, Intune software deployment, and specialized areas like Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and machine learning applications.\n\nTheir consultant recruitment patterns show concentration in six key areas: **cloud architects** building Azure platforms for large organizations, **Java and C# developers** with modern frameworks, **data architects** specializing in data flow mapping and MSSQL, **application modernization specialists** handling package management and deployment, **Domain-Driven Design experts** facilitating workshops and technical coaching, and **financial compliance specialists** particularly in AML systems. This technology mix positions them strongly for organizations undergoing digital transformation, cloud migration, or regulatory compliance initiatives in the Danish market.\n\n## Client relationships built on financial sector expertise\n\nZenit's client base concentrates heavily in Denmark's **financial services sector**\u2014their origin market where founding leadership built core competencies. Major named clients include PensionDanmark (Denmark's largest labor market pension company), Bluegarden/Multidata (managing payroll for 20% of Scandinavian wage earners), TopDanmark, K\u00f8bst\u00e6dernes Forsikring, BRF Kredit, and insurance companies. Beyond financial services, they serve public sector organizations through SKI framework agreements, plus clients in energy, retail, academic, and unemployment insurance sectors.\n\nThe **PensionDanmark case study** demonstrates their capability at scale. For a major Azure cloud platform migration project, Zenit doubled consultant staffing for one year to compress a 2-year timeline, providing experienced consultants who understood financial governance and compliance requirements without lengthy onboarding. IT Director Peter Juncker emphasized their consultants come as \"sensible and self-reliant people\" who understand pension company regulations aren't surprising but expected.\n\nTheir **14-year partnership with Bluegarden** showcases relationship durability. COO Per Hviid described the collaboration as \"professionally very strong and stable,\" noting Zenit consistently delivers the right consultants while maintaining pricing stability even during favorable market conditions. He specifically valued their flexibility and ability to deliver specific competencies on short notice\u2014critical for a company affecting 750,000 Danish employees' monthly paychecks.\n\nRecurring themes across client testimonials include **trust and transparency** (\"never afraid that consultants will package things instead of being straightforward\"), **industry-specific knowledge** (especially financial sector regulations and compliance), **honest communication without overselling**, and **consultant quality** backed by rigorous vetting. BRF Kredit's IT Manager Jens Christian Hansen noted their consultants' financial sector experience means \"the consultant can go more directly to work without a long introduction to the industry\"\u2014a significant efficiency advantage in regulated environments.\n\nThe company maintains that their first customers from 1997-98 remain active clients today, demonstrating exceptional relationship longevity in a competitive market. This retention suggests genuine value delivery beyond initial sales promises.\n\n## Competing in Denmark's $640M IT consulting market\n\nThe Danish IT consulting and implementation market reached **$640 million USD in 2024** and projects to $776.86 million by 2029 at a 4.04% CAGR. Denmark ranks 2nd in the EU for digital competitiveness with 85% of citizens actively using online services and fully digitalized government communications. The broader IT services market totals $12.16 billion, growing 5.26% annually. This highly digitized economy with tech-savvy populations creates strong demand for expert IT consultants, though Danish IT services typically cost 15-20% more than EU averages.\n\nZenit faces competition from **multiple tiers of firms**. Large international players include McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, Cognizant, TCS, and Infosys offering global resources and brand recognition. Nordic and Danish firms like Implement (ranked #6 in 2020 Graduateships), Novo Nordisk Consulting, Valcon, Twoday (~2,050 employees), Netcompany-Intrasoft, and Right People Group compete directly in the local market. Similar IT consulting houses include NETIP A/S, ENVO IT A/S, CGI, Hyperbolic, and ProData Consult (founded 1989).\n\nZenit's **competitive differentiation** rests on five pillars. First, their rigorous consultant selection maintaining \"only the best of the best\" through comprehensive recruitment evaluating technical skills and human qualities. Second, their matching precision leveraging 27 years of industry knowledge to align consultant capabilities with client needs and organizational culture. Third, their support philosophy claiming freelance consultants from Zenit deliver more value than identical consultants from competitors because of comprehensive backing. Fourth, their quality assurance process with immediate post-start follow-up and continuous evaluation. Fifth, their cultural values emphasizing transparency, honesty, and relationship longevity over short-term profit maximization.\n\nMarket trends affecting Zenit include **surging cloud migration demand** (their heavy Azure focus positions them well), increased cybersecurity emphasis, AI/ML integration requirements, cross-industry digital transformation, talent scarcity driving salary increases (IDA projects 7% engineering salary hikes in 2024), remote/hybrid work models, and growing ESG/sustainability expectations. Their 2019 UN Global Compact participation and dedicated Sustainability Manager address the latter trend. The company's description as \"one of Denmark's largest consulting firms\" and \"leading IT consultancy\" suggests mid-to-large player status, though exact market share remains undisclosed.\n\n## Leadership transition marks new growth phase\n\nAfter 27 years leading Zenit Consult, **founder Michael Willumsen stepped down as CEO in 2024** while remaining owner and director. New CEO **Jan Hansen** now leads the company's next growth phase. Willumsen's entrepreneurial background spans 28+ years across multiple ventures including director positions at Axel Invest ApS, TAMS HOLDING ApS, and board membership at MS Branding A/S.\n\nThe current C-suite features **Lisa Bindner as COO/Administrationsdirekt\u00f8r**, bringing legal education and expertise in sustainable solutions, conflict resolution, organizational development, and HR/personnel law. Her responsibilities span tender processes, GDPR compliance, CSR initiatives, and creating the organizational infrastructure. She's described as having \"strong social competencies, empathy, and ability to build trust\" with fluency in English and German. **Tina Hammerstr\u00f8m serves as CFO** managing financial operations and oversight.\n\nThe **sales organization** comprises four identified sales managers plus Karsten Petersen as Sales & Consulting Manager, indicating significant business development infrastructure. The **sourcing division** includes four senior sourcing managers and additional sourcing managers responsible for managing the 1,400+ consultant database and matching consultants to projects. Supporting functions include a Bid Manager, Office Manager Puk Wendler, Back Office Manager, Financial Controller, and notably a **Sustainability Manager**\u2014a dedicated role demonstrating commitment to corporate responsibility.\n\nHistorical partners include **Bjarne Thorsen** (co-founder and partner from 1997-2022, no longer active) and previous executives whose roles have evolved during the 2024 leadership transition. The organizational structure maintains a lean core team of approximately 40-50 employees focused on sales, sourcing, operations, and administration, while the extended network of 1,400+ freelance consultants executes client projects.\n\nCompany culture emphasizes **\"100% support for consultants\"** as their foundational philosophy, claiming consultants perform better work when fully backed by their placement firm. Regular consultant meetings with sports activities, social gatherings, and professional development workshops foster community. Their UN Global Compact participation since October 17, 2019 (next Communication on Progress due July 31, 2025) plus support for Danske Hospitalsklovne (Danish Hospital Clowns) demonstrates corporate social responsibility. Consultant testimonials consistently emphasize transparency, honesty, strong matching, flexibility, and professional standards\u2014with one noting Zenit is \"not as 'puffed up' as other companies in the industry.\"\n\n## Recent developments signal strategic evolution\n\nThe **2024 leadership transition** from founder Michael Willumsen to new CEO Jan Hansen represents the most significant organizational change in Zenit's 27-year history. This succession planning suggests maturation beyond founder-led operations while Willumsen retains ownership and directorship for continuity.\n\n**Brand refresh and repositioning** occurred through partnership with Sebastian Sejer & Co design agency, developing new brand strategy and visual identity ahead of their relaunch. The professional redesign positions them as \"one of Denmark's largest consulting firms\" with updated communications across all channels. This investment in brand equity indicates ambitions for continued growth and market presence.\n\nSocial responsibility initiatives expanded in 2024 with a **10,000 DKK donation to Danmarks Indsamling** (part of 100+ million DKK total raised) and ongoing support for Danske Hospitalsklovne. Their UN Global Compact active participation continues with the next Communication on Progress due July 2025, maintaining accountability to the Ten Principles.\n\n**Technology focus shifts toward cloud and modern architecture**. Throughout 2024, intensive recruitment targeted cloud architects for Azure platform development, Domain-Driven Design specialists, application modernization consultants, and financial compliance experts in AML/ML systems. Specific job postings in Copenhagen, Roskilde, Aarhus, Silkeborg, and the Triangle Region indicate geographic expansion of service delivery while maintaining Denmark-only focus. The heavy Azure emphasis aligns with broader market trends as enterprises accelerate cloud migration.\n\nCompany events maintained consultant community engagement. The **2024 Winter Party** at Teaterk\u00e6lderen featured entertainment and networking, while other gatherings included discussions on AI and technology trends with industry leaders like IBM Denmark. These regular social and professional events reinforce their consultant support philosophy and create differentiation from pure transactional staffing firms.\n\n## Contact information and physical presence\n\n**Headquarters (Sj\u00e6lland/Zealand):** Vandt\u00e5rnsvej 77, 2860 S\u00f8borg, Denmark\u2014located near Copenhagen providing access to the capital region's dense business ecosystem. Phone: +45 46 99 19 03. The office welcomes in-person visits with informal accessibility (\"happy to give you a cup of coffee and a candy if you stop by\").\n\n**Aarhus Office (Jylland/Jutland):** Kannikegade 16 A, 3rd floor, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark\u2014positioned in Denmark's second-largest city serving Central and Northern Jutland markets. Phone: +45 40 92 19 20.\n\nA secondary address appears in business registries at **Dybendalsv\u00e6nget 2, 2630 Taastrup**, which may be a previous location or administrative address. The recent move from Taastrup to S\u00f8borg suggests office consolidation or relocation strategy.\n\n**Email contacts** include info@zenit.dk for general inquiries and client meetings, search@zenit.dk or blivkonsulent@zenit.dk for consultant recruitment, and individual @zenit.dk addresses for all staff members. The company maintains professional accessibility with direct phone numbers published for key personnel.\n\n**Digital presence** centers on LinkedIn (5,060+ followers at dk.linkedin.com/company/zenit-consult) with regular postings of consultant opportunities, company updates, and industry engagement. Their Facebook page (facebook.com/zenitconsult) shows 199 likes with lower activity levels. The website www.zenit.dk underwent complete redesign with new visual identity, featuring client testimonials, case studies, service descriptions, and consultant recruitment information.\n\n**Business registration:** CVR number 20515708, Aktieselskab (A/S) legal structure, share capital 500,000 DKK, NACE code 620200 (IT consulting services). The company operates exclusively within Denmark's borders with no international presence\u2014a deliberate strategic choice focusing resources on deep Danish market knowledge.\n\n## Strategic intelligence for digital consultants\n\n**Market positioning opportunities:** Zenit's exclusive Denmark focus and financial sector concentration create potential partnership opportunities for international firms needing local market access or specialized consultants. Their 1,400+ consultant database provides rapid resource scaling for project peaks without long-term employment commitments.\n\n**Technology alignment:** If your projects involve **Azure cloud migration, Domain-Driven Design implementation, MSSQL database systems, or financial compliance requirements** (particularly AML systems), Zenit's consultant pool aligns directly with these capabilities. Their recent heavy recruitment in these areas suggests both capability depth and client demand.\n\n**Competitive intelligence:** Their emphasis on relationship quality over transactional efficiency means they're less price-competitive but more suitable for **complex, regulated environments requiring consultants who understand governance frameworks**. The 14-year Bluegarden partnership and decades-long client relationships indicate they excel in stable, long-term engagements rather than rapid staff augmentation.\n\n**Procurement considerations:** For public sector work, Zenit holds **SKI framework agreements 02.06, 02.14, 02.17, and SKI 17.13**, streamlining procurement processes for government entities. This pre-qualification accelerates consultant sourcing for qualifying projects.\n\n**Cultural fit assessment:** Client testimonials consistently emphasize **transparency, honest communication, and straightforward advice without overselling**. If your project culture values directness and expects consultants to integrate quickly without extensive hand-holding, Zenit's philosophy aligns well. Their consultants are described as \"sensible and self-reliant\" rather than requiring extensive support.\n\n**Differentiation from competitors:** Unlike large international consultancies offering standardized methodologies and junior consultants, or pure staffing agencies providing bodies without support, Zenit occupies a middle ground\u2014experienced independent consultants with institutional backing. This model works best when you need **senior-level expertise without the overhead of Big 4 firms** but want more quality assurance than direct freelancer sourcing.\n\n**Risk considerations:** The 2024 leadership transition from founder to professional CEO introduces execution risk during the transition period. Their exclusive Denmark focus limits international project support. Reliance on independent consultants rather than employees may affect consistency, though their quality assurance processes aim to mitigate this. The private ownership and undisclosed financial details limit transparency compared to public competitors.\n\n**Growth trajectory indicators:** Recent brand refresh, leadership succession, office relocation, and intensive recruitment in cloud/modern architecture suggest a company in **active growth phase transitioning from founder-led to professionally managed**. The estimated $269 million revenue with 40-50 core staff indicates strong revenue per employee, typical of consultant placement models with high-margin services.\n\nFor digital consultants and project managers in the Danish market, Zenit Consult represents a **proven resource for sourcing senior IT consultants** with particular strength in financial services, cloud transformation, and regulated environments where industry knowledge and compliance understanding provide genuine efficiency gains over generalist consultants.", "created_at": "2025-10-25T14:49:32.827829+00:00"}, {"uuid": "bf8e92e7-cf58-4d17-8f6a-e3a8e97387fb", "filename": "Atlas_Pitch_CheatSheet_20251026.md", "content": "# \u00f0\u0178\u017d\u00af ATLAS GROUP PITCH - QUICK REFERENCE\n## Your One-Page Cheat Sheet (Take this into the meeting!)\n\n---\n\n## \u00f0\u0178\u017d\u00ac THE FLOW (15 minutes)\n\n**1:30** \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Who we are + What we do  \n**4:00** \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Case 1: Prototype (Story \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Results)  \n**7:30** \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Case 2: AI Optimization (Story \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Results)  \n**11:00** \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Case 3: Database (Story \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Results)  \n**14:00** \u00e2\u2020\u2019 How we work + Next steps  \n**15:00** \u00e2\u2020\u2019 END (leave 5 min for questions)\n\n---\n\n## \u00f0\u0178\u201c\u2013 THE THREE STORIES (Ultra-condensed)\n\n### CASE 1: Prototype to Production\n- **Problem**: \"Customer needs something but we don't know how to build it yet\"\n- **Our approach**: \"Let's build it together in 3 weeks, validate first\"\n- **Quote**: \"Fedt mand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hvordan laver vi det til virkelighed?\"\n- **Impact**: From uncertainty to validated idea, then scale\n- **Time to say**: 3:30 minutes\n\n### CASE 2: Responsible AI \n- **Problem**: \"We spend 2 hours finding one candidate (wasted people-time)\"\n- **Our approach**: \"Build AI system that matches intelligently in 5 minutes\"\n- **Impact**: 10 hours saved/week per employee, 40% more good matches\n- **Key message**: \"AI makes people better, not obsolete\"\n- **Time to say**: 3:30 minutes\n\n### CASE 3: Consultant Database\n- **Problem**: \"We need 3 architects NOW \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where do we find them?\"\n- **Our approach**: \"Intelligent database matches on 4 criteria\"\n- **Impact**: 24 hours vs 4 weeks, higher quality matches\n- **Key message**: \"You get the exact people you need, not a list to sort through\"\n- **Time to say**: 3:30 minutes\n\n---\n\n## \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00ac YOUR OPENING LINES (memorize one)\n\n**Option A - Direct:**\n\"We specialize in three things: getting from idea to proof-of-concept quickly, building intelligence into your processes, and delivering solutions that actually scale.

We work primarily in financial services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c banks, pension funds, fintechs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because that's where high stakes and high standards meet. We're specialists, not generalists.\"\n\n### For Slide 4 (Prototype story)\n*Script (not for reading):*\n\"Let me tell you about a client we worked with recently. They had a really clear vision for what they needed, but like most people, they struggled to articulate it. The traditional approach would be: write a 100-page spec, meet for 3 months, argue about details, then finally write code. Instead, we said \u00e2\u20ac\u201c let's just build it. Within three weeks, we had a working prototype that showed exactly what they needed. And the response was: 'This is amazing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how do we make this real?' That's the moment you know you've validated the idea.

It is NOT a hire/no-hire\nrecommendation---it indicates relative alignment strength.\n\n**12.2 Component Weights**\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  **Component**           **Weight**   **Description**\n  ----------------------- ------------ -----------------------------------\n  Hard Skills Match       35%          Required skills from job\n                                       description\n\n  Experience Relevance    25%          Years + domain match\n\n  Industry Alignment      15%          Same/adjacent industry experience\n\n  Seniority Fit           15%          Title level appropriate for role\n\n  Location Match          10%          Geography compatibility\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**12.3 Calculation Methodology**\n\n**12.3.1 Hard Skills Match (35%)**\n\nUses ESCO taxonomy for skill normalization. Semantic similarity (cosine\nsimilarity \\> 0.85) for non-exact matches. Score = (exact_matches +\nsemantic_matches) / total_required_skills.\n\n**12.3.2 Experience Relevance (25%)**\n\nPenalizes both under and over-qualification. Sweet spot: 70-130% of\nrequired years. Over-qualification (\\>130%) receives slight penalty due\nto flight risk.\n\n**12.3.3 Industry Alignment (15%)**\n\nSame industry: 100%. Adjacent industry (e.g., fintech \u2192 banking): 75%.\nUnrelated: 30% (transferable skills baseline).\n\n**12.3.4 Seniority Fit (15%)**\n\nExact match: 100%. One level senior: 85%. One level junior (stretch):\n75%. Overqualified (\\>1 level): 60%. Underqualified: 50%.\n\n**12.3.5 Location Match (10%)**\n\nRemote job: 100%. Same city: 100%. Same country + hybrid: 85%. Willing\nto relocate: 70%. Same country only: 50%. International: 30%.\n\n**12.4 Confidence Score Calculation**\n\nEach alignment score includes a confidence level (Low/Medium/High) based\non data completeness:\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  **Confidence Level**    **Completeness Score**  **Meaning**\n  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------\n  High                    \u226575%                    Complete profile data,\n                                                  high certainty\n\n  Medium                  45-74%                  Partial data, moderate\n                                                  certainty\n\n  Low                     \\<45%                   Limited data, verify in\n                                                  interview\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**13.

The 80-90% cost reduction versus traditional\nagencies is validated by extensive fee benchmarking across European\nmarkets.\n\nHowever, **Step 3 (Personality Profiling) presents unacceptable legal\nrisk in its current form**. Both GDPR Article 22 and the EU AI Act\nclassify automated personality assessment in recruitment as high-risk,\nrequiring extensive compliance measures that would fundamentally change\nthe product design.\n\n**Recommendation:** Proceed with Phase 1 MVP (Steps 1, 2, 4 only) while\nengaging legal counsel to explore compliant alternatives for personality\ninsights. The revised \u20ac300/candidate offering still delivers significant\nvalue and positions the product for market entry within 2-4 weeks.\n\nNext Steps\n\n5.  Engage Danish GDPR specialist for formal compliance review\n\n6.  Validate \u20ac300 price point with 10 Danish HR managers\n\n7.  Design Bright Data API integration architecture\n\n8.  Develop brand positioning strategy emphasizing transparency and\n    compliance\n\n9.

Be clear and specific\n   - Clearly state your task or question at the beginning of your message.\n   - Provide context and details to help Claude understand your needs.\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Help me with a presentation.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need help creating a 10-slide presentation for our quarterly sales meeting. The presentation should cover our Q2 sales performance, top-selling products, and sales targets for Q3. Please provide an outline with key points for each slide.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides specific details about the task, including the number of slides, the purpose of the presentation, and the key topics to be covered.\n\n### 2. Use examples\n   - Provide examples of the kind of output you're looking for.\n   - If you want a specific format or style, show Claude an example.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write a professional email.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to write a professional email to a client about a project delay. Here's a similar email I've sent before:\n\n   'Dear [Client],\n   I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the progress of [Project Name]. Unfortunately, we've encountered an unexpected issue that will delay our completion date by approximately two weeks. We're working diligently to resolve this and will keep you updated on our progress.\n   Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n   Best regards,\n   [Your Name]'\n\n   Help me draft a new email following a similar tone and structure, but for our current situation where we're delayed by a month due to supply chain issues.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides a concrete example of the desired style and tone, giving Claude a clear reference point for the new email.\n\n### 3. Encourage thinking\n   - For complex tasks, ask Claude to \"think step-by-step\" or \"explain your reasoning.\"\n   - This can lead to more accurate and detailed responses.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"How can I improve team productivity?\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I'm looking to improve my team's productivity. Think through this step-by-step, considering the following factors:\n   1. Current productivity blockers (e.g., too many meetings, unclear priorities)\n   2. Potential solutions (e.g., time management techniques, project management tools)\n   3. Implementation challenges\n   4. Methods to measure improvement\n\n   For each step, please provide a brief explanation of your reasoning. Then summarize your ideas at the end.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt asks Claude to think through the problem systematically, providing a guided structure for the response and asking for explanations of the reasoning process. It also prompts Claude to create a summary at the end for easier reading.\n\n### 4. Iterative refinement\n   - If Claude's first response isn't quite right, ask for clarifications or modifications.\n   - You can always say \"That's close, but can you adjust X to be more like Y?\"\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Make it better.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"That\u2019s a good start, but please refine it further. Make the following adjustments:\n   1. Make the tone more casual and friendly\n   2. Add a specific example of how our product has helped a customer\n   3. Shorten the second paragraph to focus more on the benefits rather than the features\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides specific feedback and clear instructions for improvements, allowing Claude to make targeted adjustments instead of just relying on Claude\u2019s innate sense of what \u201cbetter\u201d might be \u2014 which is likely different from the user\u2019s definition!\n\n### 5. Leverage Claude's knowledge\n   - Claude has broad knowledge across many fields. Don't hesitate to ask for explanations or background information\n   - Be sure to include relevant context and details so that Claude\u2019s response is maximally targeted to be helpful\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"What is marketing? How do I do it?\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I'm developing a marketing strategy for a new eco-friendly cleaning product line. Can you provide an overview of current trends in green marketing? Please include:\n   1. Key messaging strategies that resonate with environmentally conscious consumers\n   2. Effective channels for reaching this audience\n   3. Examples of successful green marketing campaigns from the past year\n   4. Potential pitfalls to avoid (e.g., greenwashing accusations)\n\n   This information will help me shape our marketing approach.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt asks for specific, contextually relevant  information that leverages Claude's broad knowledge base. It provides context for how the information will be used, which helps Claude frame its answer in the most relevant way.\n\n### 6. Use role-playing\n   - Ask Claude to adopt a specific role or perspective when responding.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Help me prepare for a negotiation.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"You are a fabric supplier for my backpack manufacturing company. I'm preparing for a negotiation with this supplier to reduce prices by 10%. As the supplier, please provide:\n   1. Three potential objections to our request for a price reduction\n   2. For each objection, suggest a counterargument from my perspective\n   3. Two alternative proposals the supplier might offer instead of a straight price cut\n\n   Then, switch roles and provide advice on how I, as the buyer, can best approach this negotiation to achieve our goal.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt uses role-playing to explore multiple perspectives of the negotiation, providing a more comprehensive preparation. Role-playing also encourages Claude to more readily adopt the nuances of specific perspectives, increasing the intelligence and performance of Claude\u2019s response.\n\n\n## Task-specific tips and examples\n\n### Content Creation\n\n1. **Specify your audience**\n   - Tell Claude who the content is for.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write something about cybersecurity.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to write a blog post about cybersecurity best practices for small business owners. The audience is not very tech-savvy, so the content should be:\n   1. Easy to understand, avoiding technical jargon where possible\n   2. Practical, with actionable tips they can implement quickly\n   3. Engaging and slightly humorous to keep their interest\n\n   Please provide an outline for a 1000-word blog post that covers the top 5 cybersecurity practices these business owners should adopt.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt specifies the audience, desired tone, and key characteristics of the content, giving Claude clear guidelines for creating appropriate and effective output.\n\n2. **Define the tone and style**\n   - Describe the desired tone.\n   - If you have a style guide, mention key points from it.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write a product description.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Please help me write a product description for our new ergonomic office chair. Use a professional but engaging tone. Our brand voice is friendly, innovative, and health-conscious. The description should:\n   1. Highlight the chair's key ergonomic features\n   2. Explain how these features benefit the user's health and productivity\n   3. Include a brief mention of the sustainable materials used\n   4. End with a call-to-action encouraging readers to try the chair\n\n   Aim for about 200 words.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides clear guidance on the tone, style, and specific elements to include in the product description.\n\n3. **Define output structure**\n   - Provide a basic outline or list of points you want covered.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Create a presentation on our company results.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to create a presentation on our Q2 results. Structure this with the following sections:\n   1. Overview\n   2. Sales Performance\n   3. Customer Acquisition\n   4. Challenges\n   5. Q3 Outlook\n\n   For each section, suggest 3-4 key points to cover, based on typical business presentations. Also, recommend one type of data visualization (e.g., graph, chart) that would be effective for each section.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides a clear structure and asks for specific elements (key points and data visualizations) for each section.\n\n### Document summary and Q&A\n\n1. **Be specific about what you want**\n   - Ask for a summary of specific aspects or sections of the document.\n   - Frame your questions clearly and directly.\n   - Be sure to specify what kind of summary (output structure, content type) you want\n\n2. **Use the document names**\n   - Refer to attached documents by name.\n\n3. **Ask for citations**\n   - Request that Claude cites specific parts of the document in its answers.\n\nHere is an example that combines all three of the above techniques:\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Summarize this report for me.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I've attached a 50-page market research report called 'Tech Industry Trends 2023'. Can you provide a 2-paragraph summary focusing on AI and machine learning trends? Then, please answer these questions:\n   1. What are the top 3 AI applications in business for this year?\n   2. How is machine learning impacting job roles in the tech industry?\n   3. What potential risks or challenges does the report mention regarding AI adoption?\n\n   Please cite specific sections or page numbers when answering these questions.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt specifies the exact focus of the summary, provides specific questions, and asks for citations, ensuring a more targeted and useful response. It also indicates the ideal summary output structure, such as limiting the response to 2 paragraphs.\n\n### Data analysis and visualization\n\n1. **Specify the desired format**\n   - Clearly describe the format you want the data in.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Analyze our sales data.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I've attached a spreadsheet called 'Sales Data 2023'. Can you analyze this data and present the key findings in the following format:\n\n   1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\n\n   2. Key Metrics:\n      - Total sales for each quarter\n      - Top-performing product category\n      - Highest growth region\n\n   3. Trends:\n      - List 3 notable trends, each with a brief explanation\n\n   4. Recommendations:\n      - Provide 3 data-driven recommendations, each with a brief rationale\n\n   After the analysis, suggest three types of data visualizations that would effectively communicate these findings.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides a clear structure for the analysis, specifies key metrics to focus on, and asks for recommendations and visualization suggestions for further formatting.\n\n### Brainstorming\n 1. Use Claude to generate ideas by asking for a list of possibilities or alternatives.\n     - Be specific about what topics you want Claude to cover in its brainstorming\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Give me some team-building ideas.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"We need to come up with team-building activities for our remote team of 20 people. Can you help me brainstorm by:\n   1. Suggesting 10 virtual team-building activities that promote collaboration\n   2. For each activity, briefly explain how it fosters teamwork\n   3. Indicate which activities are best for:\n      a) Ice-breakers\n      b) Improving communication\n      c) Problem-solving skills\n   4. Suggest one low-cost option and one premium option.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides specific parameters for the brainstorming session, including the number of ideas, type of activities, and additional categorization, resulting in a more structured and useful output.\n\n2. Request responses in specific formats like bullet points, numbered lists, or tables for easier reading.\n\n   Bad Prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Compare project management software options.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good Prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"We're considering three different project management software options: Asana, Trello, and Microsoft Project. Can you compare these in a table format using the following criteria:\n   1. Key Features\n   2. Ease of Use\n   3. Scalability\n   4. Pricing (include specific plans if possible)\n   5. Integration capabilities\n   6. Best suited for (e.g., small teams, enterprise, specific industries)\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt requests a specific structure (table) for the comparison, provides clear criteria, making the information easy to understand and apply.\n  \n## Troubleshooting, minimizing hallucinations, and maximizing performance\n\n1. **Allow Claude to acknowledge uncertainty**\n   - Tell Claude that it should say it doesn\u2019t know if it doesn\u2019t know. Ex. \u201cIf you're unsure about something, it's okay to admit it. Just say you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n2. **Break down complex tasks**\n   - If a task seems too large and Claude is missing steps or not performing certain steps well, break it into smaller steps and work through them with Claude one message at a time.\n\n3. **Include all contextual information for new requests**\n   - Claude doesn't retain information from previous conversations, so include all necessary context in each new conversation.\n\n## Example good vs. bad prompt examples\n\nThese are more examples that combine multiple prompting techniques to showcase the stark difference between ineffective and highly effective prompts.\n\n### Example 1: Marketing strategy development\n\nBad prompt:\n<prompt>\n\"Help me create a marketing strategy.\"\n</prompt>\n\nGood prompt:\n<prompt>\n\"As a senior marketing consultant, I need your help developing a comprehensive marketing strategy for our new eco-friendly smartphone accessory line.

Derudover anbefaler jeg, at vi optimerer Google Analytics til at spille bedre sammen med Ads og Tag Manager.

Brugeradgange. Det er vigtigt at tech.dk e-mails har admin rettigheder til det hele, inden samarbejdet slutter. \n- Google tag manager:  Kan se, at mailen admin@nordicadpartner.dk er den eneste der har admin rettigheder til kontoen, hvilket i princippet betyder, at hvis de ville, kunne lukke jer ude af kontoen. \n- Google Analytics og Google ads, her har jeg admin rettigheder, s\u00e5 der er ikke brug for noget fra deres side. \n- Er der andre platforme de har haft adgange til, interne emails, eller betalingskort etc. s\u00e5 skal den adgang ogs\u00e5 oph\u00e6ves naturligvis. \n\n2. I m\u00e5 gerne sende mig, de opdateringer og performance rapporter I har f\u00e5et fra dem, m\u00e5ned til m\u00e5ned. S\u00e5 jeg f\u00e5r et indblik i deres tilgang til kampagnerne.. \nHvis ikke I har det, s\u00e5 ville jeg bede om, en oversigt over hvad de har lavet de forskellige m\u00e5neder, og hvilke \u00e6ndringer der er lavet ift. optimeringer etc. \nDet er op til jer, hvor meget I beder dem om, men der er brugt over 200K p\u00e5 annoncering i Google Ads, s\u00e5 jeg vil mene at I har ret til at vide, hvilke tanker de har gjort sig ifm. deres kampagne ops\u00e6tning etc. \n\nCheckliste: \n\nGoogle Tag Manager : \n- at Kim, og Mikkel f\u00e5r admin rettigheder.

Samt et forslag til en langsigtet samarbejdsaftale, der kan hj\u00e6lpe jer med at optimere og udvikle jeres marketingstrategi.\n\nBrug af annoncekroner og rum til forbedring\nKort fortalt bruger I rigtig mange penge p\u00e5 annoncering, og jeg vil mene, at der er mange ting, der kan optimeres, s\u00e5 I p\u00e5 relativt kort sigt vil kunne f\u00e5 en del mere ud af jeres annoncekroner.\nI maj m\u00e5ned har I d.d. brugt 180.000 kr. kun p\u00e5 Meta, for ca. 1042 konverteringer. Det giver en konverteringspris p\u00e5 ca. 173 kr. Det varierer meget fra land til land, og fx i Danmark har I brugt i gennemsnit 139 kr. pr konvertering (med retargeting kampagner).\n\nDer er naturligvis altid nogle ubekendte forbundet med disse tal, da jeres tracking ikke er sat optimalt op (specifikt jeres conversion API). Det betyder, at I muligvis har en bedre CPA, men at det ikke kan trackes, og at Meta derfor ikke kan optimere det. Uanset hvad vil I f\u00e5 langt mere ud af annonceringen ved at have en bedre struktur og et bedre tracking setup.\n\nPrim\u00e6re optimeringspunkter\nMin klare opfattelse er, at der er mange omr\u00e5der at s\u00e6tte ind. Der er dog i mine \u00f8jne fire prim\u00e6re omr\u00e5der, der vil kunne skabe nogle hurtige resultater for jer:\nGranulering af jeres targeting:\nPt. m\u00e5lretter I virkelig store m\u00e5lgrupper - dvs. alle mellem 18-65 i et givet land. Der mangler en del udspecificering, fx er der ikke specificeret sprog - dvs. fx en engelsktalende i Spanien vil kun se spansk annoncering, og I bruger h\u00f8jst sandsynligt en del penge p\u00e5 at n\u00e5 ud til mennesker i m\u00e5lgrupperne, der ikke konverterer.\nKampagneops\u00e6tning:\nPt er jeres kampagner sat op per produkt, men hver adset d\u00e6kker over flere forskellige lande. Det g\u00f8r, at I mister en del potentiale for optimering.\nOpdatering af kampagne objektiver:\nI bruger lige nu k\u00f8bsbegivenheder til bred m\u00e5lretning, hvilket resulterer i lavere konverteringsrater og penge tabt.\nOps\u00e6tning af funnels og retargeting kampagner:\nJeg vil mene, at det er best practice at dele sine potentielle kunder op i en funnel i sin annoncering, s\u00e5 man laver specifik annoncering alt efter, hvor langt kunden er p\u00e5 k\u00f8bsrejsen. I jeres setup k\u00f8rer I ingen funnels, men blot direkte annoncering samt et enkelt retargeting setup p\u00e5 website visits. Fordelen ved, at I har brugt en masse penge p\u00e5 annoncering er, at I har masser af data og har ramt en masse mennesker, dvs. I har rige muligheder for at benytte jer af retargeting.\nAndre optimeringspunkter: \nUdover de ovenn\u00e6vnte punkter, som jeg vil mene er de helt lavth\u00e6ngende frugter, er der ogs\u00e5 en del i jeres tekniske setup, jeg tror vil kunne g\u00f8re en forskel.\nHer er de kort i punktform:\n\nOps\u00e6tning af datatracking: \nKomplet ops\u00e6tning af server-side tagging, en moderne l\u00f8sning for at omg\u00e5 begr\u00e6nsninger som adblockere og browserbaserede restriktioner p\u00e5 tredjepartscookies.\nOptimering af analytiske v\u00e6rkt\u00f8jer som Google Analytics, Tag manager, Facebook Conversion Api, evt. for at indsamle pr\u00e6cise data om brugeradf\u00e6rd p\u00e5 jeres website.\nDette vil inkludere sporing af interaktioner som sidevisninger, overv\u00e5gning af vigtige events, og klik p\u00e5 n\u00f8gleelementer. Samt evt. tracking \u00f8nsker fra jer.\nTydelige KPI'er defineres i samr\u00e5d med jer for at sikre, at vi m\u00e5ler det, der betyder mest for Kite Danmark.\n\nOptimering af placeringer\nUdvidede annonce varianter\nBrug af dynamisk kreativ optimering\nEffektivisering af budgetstyring\nH\u00e5ndtering/overv\u00e5gning af annonce frekvens for at undg\u00e5 ad fatigue\nImplementering af dynamiske produktannoncer\nKorrekt Facebook Pixel installation\nJeg vil alts\u00e5 mene, at der er mange ting at tage fat p\u00e5, og masser af steder, hvor der kan optimeres.\n\nForslag til samarbejdsaftale\nI mine \u00f8jne er den bedste m\u00e5de at samarbejde p\u00e5 en fast, m\u00e5nedlig aftale. Det vil indeb\u00e6re et antal dedikerede timer om ugen samt nogle emner, vi sammen bliver enige om, er vores fokusomr\u00e5der.\n\nLangsigtede perspektiver\nDerudover ser jeg store muligheder i et langsigtet samarbejde, her er mulige punkter vi kan tage fat p\u00e5:\nUdvikling og justering af marketingstrategi: Omfatter alle platforme og sikrer alignment med jeres forretningsm\u00e5l.\nBrandopbygning og positionering: Styrke brandidentitet gennem m\u00e5lrettede kampagner og konkurrentanalyser.\nOptimering af kreative indhold: Forbedre kreative materialer med AI-v\u00e6rkt\u00f8jer.\nData-drevne beslutninger: Implementering af dataanalytiske rammer.\nPersonalisering og kundeoplevelse: Skr\u00e6ddersyede marketingkampagner med AI.\nPerformance monitoring og optimering: Regelm\u00e6ssige reviews og optimeringssessioner.\nUdvidelse til nye kanaler og markeder: Nye platforme som TikTok og Pinterest.\nTr\u00e6ning og udvikling af interne teams: Tr\u00e6ningssessioner for jeres marketingteam.\nDer er mange ting at tage fat p\u00e5, og jeg vil mene, at st\u00f8rrelsen af jeres virksomhed ogs\u00e5 kr\u00e6ver,\nat der bliver lagt en del tid for at alting kan g\u00f8res ordentligt. Mit bud lyder derfor p\u00e5:\n\nM\u00e5nedlig retainer:\n12 timer/uge\n36.000 kr./m\u00e5ned\n\nFor en god ordens skyld vil jeg n\u00e6vne, at jeg ikke arbejder med kontraktuelle opsigelsesvarsler andet end m\u00e5neden ud, men vil s\u00e6tte pris p\u00e5 et par m\u00e5neders varsel, hvis muligt. Jeg regner med, at vi kommer til at arbejde sammen i en l\u00e6ngere periode, og er der behov for at \u00e6ndre timetal op eller ned, s\u00e5 g\u00f8r vi selvf\u00f8lgelig bare det efter behov. I tilf\u00e6lde af opjusteringer af timetal, s\u00e5 vil dette dog v\u00e6re afh\u00e6ngig af min kalender, da andre kunder ogs\u00e5 har prioritet.\n\nMed dette setup vil jeg mene, at vi kan skabe de f\u00f8rste resultater inden for et par uger og derefter forts\u00e6tte med optimeringen.\nHvis du synes, det giver mening, starter vi med et opstartsm\u00f8de for at gennemg\u00e5 detaljerne og starte implementeringen.\n\nFor mig at se er det her helt sikkert en sp\u00e6ndende case, da der er rigtig mange optimeringspunkter, og I generelt er en sp\u00e6ndende virksomhed - s\u00e5 jeg ville synes, det var virkelig fedt at arbejde med jer.\n\nSkriv hvis der er det mindste.\nJeg g\u00e5r i gang med opdateringerne af Facebook kampagnerne, som aftalt.\n\nVi snakkes ved p\u00e5 fredag.\n\n--\nDe bedste hilsener / Best regards\nSven Arnarsson\nOwner & Marketing Specialist,\nSVC ApS\n+45 29128381\n", "created_at": "2024-07-03T19:22:46.940292+00:00"}, {"uuid": "044de184-eed1-47e6-a740-48faaeefff0a", "filename": "SVC Financials - 2024.csv", "content": "Month,Flexecharge,Tech,ELBIIL,Kite Danmark,BIGUM,WARM,Total,WORK VS DELEGATE?\r\nJanuary,,\"10,000\",\"30,000\",,,,\"40,000\",100%\r\nFebruary,,\"10,000\",\"30,000\",,,,\"40,000\",100%\r\nMarch,,\"10,000\",\"30,000\",,,,\"40,000\",100%\r\nApril,\"20,000\",\"10,000\",\"30,000\",,,,\"60,000\",80%\r\nMay,\"20,000\",\"10,000\",,,,,\"30,000\",60%\r\nJune,\"15,000\",\"10,000\",,\"15,000\",,,\"40,000\",50%\r\nJuly,\"5,000\",\"10,000\",,\"15,000\",,,\"30,000\",30%\r\nAugust,\"7,000\",\"10,000\",,\"15,000\",\"16,000\",\"20,000\",\"68,000\",60%\r\nSeptember,\"12,000\",\"10,000\",,\"15,000\",\"36,000\",\"15,000\",\"88,000\",90%\r\nOctober,\"8,000\",\"10,000\",,\"15,000\",\"12,000\",\"15,000\",\"60,000\",\r\nNovember,\"5,500\",\"10,000\",,\"15,000\",,\"15,000\",\"45,500\",\r\nDecember,\"3,500\",\"10,000\",,\"15,000\",,\"15,000\",\"43,500\",\r\nTOTAL,\"96,000\",\"120,000\",\"120,000\",\"105,000\",\"64,000\",\"80,000\",\"585,000\",74.44%", "created_at": "2024-07-03T19:44:15.391196+00:00"}, {"uuid": "263b45cf-3359-4ddb-80d1-e01b410d779a", "filename": "Google Ads Performance Interactive Infographic.tsx", "content": "import React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';\nimport { Info, ChevronDown, ChevronUp } from 'lucide-react';\n\nconst performanceData = [\n  { date: '2024-01', spend: 40000, conversions: 200, convRate: 2.5 },\n  { date: '2024-02', spend: 40000, conversions: 210, convRate: 2.6 },\n  { date: '2024-03', spend: 40000, conversions: 205, convRate: 2.55 },\n  { date: '2024-04', spend: 60000, conversions: 300, convRate: 2.7 },\n  { date: '2024-05', spend: 30000, conversions: 180, convRate: 3.0 },\n  { date: '2024-06', spend: 40000, conversions: 220, convRate: 2.8 },\n];\n\nconst events = [\n  {\n    date: \"2024-06-26\",\n    title: \"Budget Decrease for Demand Gen - TechDK\",\n    description: \"Budget decreased from DKK 244.00 to DKK 50.00\",\n    impact: \"Negative - Reduced visibility and potential leads\",\n    details: \"This significant budget reduction likely led to decreased ad impressions and clicks, potentially limiting the campaign's reach and lead generation capabilities.\"\n  },\n  {\n    date: \"2024-05-15\",\n    title: \"Performance Max Test Campaign Launch\",\n    description: \"Launched 'Performance Max-1test' campaign\",\n    impact: \"Mixed - Initial high spend with moderate conversion rate\",\n    details: \"The launch of this automated campaign type showed promise with increased conversions, but at a higher cost.

What are the most important features? What are the user interactions? What data will need to be stored and processed? What are the performance requirements?\n2. **Do some quick research to find the libraries and packages that you need to use.** You can use Google, chatGPT, or other resources to find the right packages. Consider the following factors when choosing libraries and packages:\n   * Are they well-maintained and supported?\n   * Do they have a good community?\n   * Do they meet your performance requirements?\n3. **Design the project structure and folder so that you can plan ahead based on all the requirements you have.** This will help you organize your code and make it easier to build your application. Consider the following when designing your project structure:\n   * How will you organize your code into modules and components?\n   * How will you handle data storage and retrieval?\n   * How will you handle user authentication and authorization?\n   * How will you deploy your application?\n4. **Write out the detailed requirements for your application.** This should include the core functionalities, the libraries and packages you will use, the file structure, the user interactions, the data storage and retrieval, the user authentication and authorization, and the deployment.\n\n**Building**\n\n1. **Create a new GitHub repository for your application.**\n2. **Create a new instructions.md file in your repository.**\n3. **Start writing your instructions for Cursor.** You can use the following structure:\n   * Project overview\n     * Describe the purpose of the application and its target audience.\n     * Outline the core functionalities and features.\n     * Define any technical constraints or limitations.\n   * Core functionalities\n     * Describe each functionality in detail, including the inputs, outputs, and logic involved.\n     * Provide examples or use cases to illustrate how the functionality will be used.\n   * Libraries and packages\n     * List all the libraries and packages that you will use in your application.\n     * Provide a brief description of each library or package and explain why you chose it.\n     * Include any installation or configuration instructions.\n   * File structure\n     * Describe the structure of your project, including the organization of files and folders.\n     * Explain how you plan to use modules and components.\n     * Provide any naming conventions or standards that you will be following.\n   * Code examples\n     * Provide examples of the code that you want Cursor to generate.\n     * These examples should be representative of the different types of code that you will need to write for your application.\n4. **Run Cursor.** Once you have finished writing your instructions, you can run Cursor to build your application.\n5. **Deploy your application.** Once your application is built, you can deploy it to a platform like Verso.\n\n**Additional tips**\n\n* Write detailed instructions for Cursor. The more detailed your instructions are, the more likely Cursor will be able to build your application correctly.\n* Use a logging and monitoring platform like Headon to track the performance of your application. This will help you identify and fix any problems that may arise.\n* Use a version control system like Git to track changes to your code. This will help you collaborate with other developers and revert to previous versions of your code if necessary.\n* Use a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the process of building and deploying your application. This will help you save time and ensure that your application is always up-to-date.\n* Test your application thoroughly before deploying it to production. This will help you identify and fix any bugs or issues before they affect real users.\n* Monitor your application in production to ensure that it is performing as expected. This will help you identify and address any performance problems or security vulnerabilities.\n\nI hope these additional details are helpful!", "is_private": true, "is_starter_project": false, "prompt_template": "", "created_at": "2024-10-21T14:30:44.374257+00:00", "updated_at": "2024-10-21T14:30:44.374257+00:00", "creator": {"uuid": "e6a8af49-2500-4bf1-9f35-351d2c75dbcb", "full_name": "Sven A"}, "docs": [{"uuid": "48b43ebb-3b5e-40c1-9e86-6e7593f75e3a", "filename": "transcript from tut video - cursor workflow.txt", "content": "\r\n\r\nhere is a transcript from a tutorial i want to use as base\r\nTimeline\r\n\r\nChapters\r\n\r\nTranscript\r\nIntro\r\n0:00\r\nthis video is sponsored by hadong one of the best open source platform for logging monitoring and debugging your\r\n0:05\r\nlarge L model applications today I want to show you how can you make your cursor workflow 10x more effective to build\r\n0:11\r\nproduction level application with much less arrows if you don't know what cursor is it is the most popular AI code\r\n0:16\r\neditor that everyone is learning it enable anyone even 8-year-old to be able to build fully functional application\r\n0:23\r\nusing just natural language and we saw many wild example just form past week all around internet where people\r\n0:28\r\nshowcase beautiful application that they have been building with cursor but the moment you start building with cursor app yourself you probably start\r\n0:34\r\nencountering countless arrows and very hard guessing actually up running and if this is your experience the good news is\r\n0:41\r\nthat there are many things you can do to actually dramatically improve the success rate for example instead of giving cursor a simple instruction to\r\n0:48\r\nbuild out the whole web application you actually need to learn how to write the best documentation to communicate and\r\n0:53\r\nalign with cursor what are core functionalities how does n file structure sure look like including code\r\n0:58\r\nexamples and list out all the dependencies or it might be a bit unclear of which text tack that you\r\n1:04\r\nshould be using and how does cloud VZ and cursor fit together into a cohesive\r\n1:09\r\nworkflow and when to use which one with all those tips and best practice workflow I was able to dramatically\r\n1:14\r\nimprove success rate for my own purs so I'm going to show you step by step what does my workflow look like so you can\r\n1:20\r\nreplicate and build your next dream app and the example application I want to show you how to build today is a really\r\n1:26\r\ninteresting AI analytics platform called Gummy Search it basically utiliz what what lar L model is really really good\r\n1:32\r\nat which is reading through thousands of unstructured redit posts and summarize extract key information like what kind\r\n1:39\r\nof pinpoints people are struggling with and what kind of opportunities might be for solutions that people are asking for\r\n1:44\r\nand I learned about this app from one of the Greg's video where he showcased how he use Gumi search to find startup ideas\r\n1:50\r\nwhich I highly recommend and what got me really interesed in to use this as example is because getting large L model\r\n1:56\r\nreadings through huge amount unstructured data and extract insights can be us utilize for many other data\r\n2:01\r\nsource apart from just rdit like you can probably build application for Twitter Facebook group Discord or even private\r\n2:07\r\ndata source that you might got somewhere else so to hour showcase how can you use cursor to reute such social media\r\n2:12\r\nanalytics platform where it can res thousands of posts and summarize and extract key information for people to\r\n2:17\r\nfind Opportunities with a full backhand setup as well as integration with large language model monitoring platform so\r\n2:23\r\nyou can optimize cost so let's get started so to get started instead of jumping into cursor Direct ask you to\r\nStep 1 - Plan & Prep PRD\r\n2:30\r\nbuild something out we need to do some planning the first thing is we want to scope out a little bit about what kind\r\n2:35\r\nof core functionality we want to ship my process is to spit out a core scope the application has to have to be useful now\r\n2:42\r\ndo some quick research maybe talk to chbt to understand what kind of like package that I can use for core\r\n2:48\r\nfunctionalities in the end I would get cloud or 01 model to design the project structure folder so that I can plan\r\n2:55\r\nahead based on all the requirements I have and then write out the detail requirements so in order for a specific case I will create new GitHub report\r\n3:02\r\ncalled Reddit analytics platform then I will start creating a instructions. MD\r\n3:07\r\nfile and normally I would start with a file structure look something like this I would give a Pur overview and then\r\n3:12\r\nstart spit out the cool functionalities including documentations of package that we're going to use and current file\r\n3:19\r\nstructure so that I can ask 01 model to plan a little bit so in your case you can probably follow very similar structure especially if you're building\r\n3:25\r\na web application for project overview I'll just give a brief description that you are building a Reddit application\r\n3:31\r\nplatform where users can get antics of different subreddits where they can go and see the top contents as well as the\r\n3:37\r\ncategory of posts and you will be using nextjs 14 chassis in Tailwind Lucid icon\r\n3:43\r\nand in term of tax stack so nextjs is just one type of Frameworks that we are using similar to react and chassen is a\r\n3:51\r\nUI component library and telwin is a CSS Library where it will make a code more\r\n3:56\r\neasier to understand and Lucid is icon library that we can use but if you want to use other component Library you can\r\n4:02\r\njust change it here and then I'm going to start flashing out core functionality this is probably the most important part\r\n4:07\r\nI basically want to think through what are the core functionality that this app has to have in my case if I use Gummy\r\n4:14\r\nSearch as the reference we need a page to actually view all the subreddit available and user can create a new\r\n4:20\r\nsubreddit if they need and then we also need a part to revew all details for specific subred and from my experience\r\n4:28\r\nthe most useful part of Gumi search is the same where I can see the top content as well a category about which post\r\n4:34\r\nwhere people talk about solution request which post they talk about P anger and something we can even do more than gumy\r\n4:40\r\nsearch is that sometimes I have very specific type of post that I want to find so I want to enable people maybe\r\n4:47\r\nadd a new category as well so in my case I would have a few different functionalities one is the ability to\r\n4:52\r\nsee the list of available subus and add a new sub Rus and it need to display a sub page uh and we also need to Fat post\r\n5:00\r\ndata in the top post tab as well as using open AI to analyze the post data into different category SS and in the\r\n5:07\r\nend a bonus point to add new SE category and what I need to do after I basically just need to spit out all the detail\r\n5:14\r\ninteraction that I can Sy of if this is your first time writing detail product doc it probably take some time but it\r\n5:20\r\nwill be worth it so in my case I will write down the details that user can see list of available Subarus that already\r\n5:25\r\ncreated displayed in cards common ones like AMA and open AI and users can click\r\n5:30\r\non add a Reddit button which should open a model for user to paste in Reddit URL and add and after user adding a Reddit a\r\n5:37\r\nnew car should be added and in subreddit page uh clicking on each subreddit should go to Reddit page with two tabs\r\n5:44\r\nas well as other details that you can pause the video and type out later and after this core functionality next thing\r\n5:49\r\nwe want to do is to find the libraries and packages that we're going to use to build out some functionalities so there are two type of documents I would need\r\n5:56\r\nto include one is the code example for how do we get ready Reddit data so there are few ways I can go the easiest way is\r\n6:02\r\nthat you can go and ask chat gbt especially for functionality like this one where reditor is not new SC you\r\n6:08\r\nshould already have training data about how to implement things for Reddit so I can just go and ask I'm building a web\r\n6:13\r\napp using nextjs for fashion Reddit post data what is best package to use then I can say give me answer where snow wrap\r\n6:20\r\nseem to be one of the best package to use and then I can go to npmjs.com to search for that specific package so mpm\r\n6:27\r\nis like the package man manager which we're going to use to install this package later so in here it give us some\r\n6:33\r\nexamples and also link to the detailed documentations which we can take look to get more details and one thing I would\r\n6:40\r\nnormally do is I would start un cursor to give it documentation and try to spit out some proof concept of this functionality that we want so I will\r\n6:47\r\njust copy this one go back to cursor open the cursor composer and then I addm\r\n6:53\r\nuh doc where I can click on add new Doc pasting the uh link here so it were\r\n6:58\r\nadding the documentation of the snow wrap I will confirm and then here I will give a specific instruction help me\r\n7:04\r\nbuild a simple typescript file of fing recent RIT post data from past 24 hours under orama including title content\r\n7:11\r\nscore number of comments and date using snow rrap so you can see it start creating example uh script so I can\r\n7:17\r\naccept all and the first thing is I will need to get the redit API credentials so you can keep asking it about like how do\r\n7:24\r\nyou get uh Reddit API credentials but you basically go to reddit.com preference SL apps and then you can\r\n7:30\r\nclick on create another app and give a name so in our case I call Post categorizer and I want to choose script\r\n7:37\r\ndescription we can put an app that analyze Reddit posts and about Ur you\r\n7:43\r\ncan keep empty redir URL I will just keep Local Host 3000 and click on I'm\r\n7:49\r\nnot robot and create app and now you will get a credential here so I'm just going to temporarily replace a\r\n7:54\r\ncredential and the user agent you can just put it whatever client ID will be the tag\r\n7:59\r\nhere and the secret ID will be this one and here it ask for the refresh token as\r\n8:05\r\nwell by remember snow wrap off a few different ways to oos I just want to make an easy one which using the\r\n8:11\r\nusername and password so I'm going to copy this one and replace the refresh token to be username and password where\r\n8:17\r\nI can putting my username and password in next is I want to install mpm so I'll\r\n8:22\r\ncopy the command line in terminal and then do TS node fash RIT post. TS Okay\r\n8:28\r\ncool so you can see that it does return actual post data back so this code\r\n8:34\r\nexample is actually working and then I can just copy paste this thing as a code example and again just taking away\r\n8:40\r\nanother layers of potential arrows from this process by doing some research early on so what I'll do is I will copy\r\n8:46\r\nthis code example in and go back to the instruction. MD and put example here says documentation of how to use snow\r\n8:55\r\nwrap to fetch RIT post data so code example and paste this in and now we\r\n9:01\r\nalso get description that we will use no RP as a library to fetch Reddit data and I will basically do the same thing as\r\n9:07\r\ndocumentation for how to use open AI structure output to categorize the RIT post as well so our go to open AI\r\n9:13\r\ndocuments copy the link in go back to cursor add a new one and add Doc and new\r\n9:19\r\none paste in open AI structured output confirm and here I would say instruction\r\n9:25\r\nhelp me write a simple typescript to categorize the RIT post it should have output post category analysis where it\r\n9:31\r\nhas bodan value bodan basically is like true and false value for each category below solution request P anger advice\r\n9:38\r\nrequest and money talk so I will click enter so it create a simple script for me and I can just come here and\r\n9:44\r\ntemporarily replace the API key here I do notice the code here is actually not using the structure output so I'm going\r\n9:50\r\nto actually give a very specific example uh that I get from the documents and\r\n9:56\r\nthis is kind of another reason why I think this type of in Advan plan research is necessary so I would just go\r\n10:02\r\nback to cursor and then say I want you to use the open AI structured output\r\n10:08\r\nfunction use example above as reference to refactored code uh and uh if I come back out you can see that it used the uh\r\n10:15\r\nstructure output now even though the model is wrong so I will change this to be 40 mini but I will also just do some\r\n10:23\r\nquick updates because I don't really like the structure I wanted to put a description to actual Z data type here\r\n10:29\r\nhere instead so I can just choose this part of code so I can just go back to cursor composer and I want you to set a\r\n10:36\r\ndescription of each category to zone model itself instead of part of prompt so later it'll be more flexible if\r\n10:42\r\ncategories change okay now it should be all good so I will open Terminal mpm install open and zot and then do TS node\r\n10:50\r\ncategorize post. TS okay I got this Arrow okay looks like it didn't add the\r\n10:56\r\nbeta here so I'm going to paste in the beta according to the documentations\r\n11:01\r\nokay another problem I found earlier was that type script have very strict return type and previously the return type was\r\n11:07\r\ndefined ex result type we defined earlier but the actual thing we return here is string so I just remove that and\r\n11:12\r\nwe can run again cool now you can see it returned this result po play so this is also example we can include into the\r\n11:19\r\ninstruction so our add documentation for open AI structured output code example\r\n11:26\r\nand I can also include the example output and example response and at top I update uh using open AI structure output\r\n11:34\r\nfunctions so this pretty much the Croc of the initial draft the last thing I want to do is I want to include the\r\n11:40\r\ncurrent file structure to do that I will first need to set up the project so to set up project I can go to chass in they\r\n11:47\r\nhave pretty good command line I press in npx chass in at latest initial and it\r\n11:52\r\nwill ask me whether I want to create a new nextjs project first I will click Y and then give name Reddit and Antics and\r\n12:00\r\nI will choose a New York style natural uh yes then all the project has been created publicly so you can see a\r\n12:06\r\nproject folder has been created uh what I want to do is that I actually want to\r\n12:11\r\nFirst create a folder inside this project folder called instructions and move this instruction MD under that\r\n12:18\r\nfolder and now I do cursor Reddit analytics so this will open cursor in\r\n12:23\r\nthat specific folder uh if you don't have this cursor command line yet you can command shift p and then select this\r\n12:30\r\nshell command install cursor command otherwise you can always just open that specific folder from here but now I'm\r\n12:35\r\ngoing to this specific uh project folder and then open the instruction that we created earlier so let's firstly install\r\n12:41\r\na few different packages that we know we're going to need so mpm install snow wrap open Ai and z and next thing is I\r\n12:47\r\nwill create a new file called EMV do loal where I will add all the credentials in and also do MPX chassi in\r\n12:55\r\nat latest app so at default the components from chass in one be automatically add in so I'm going to\r\n13:01\r\nmanually select the ones that we know we're going to need like badge card input label sheet table tabs and enter\r\n13:10\r\nThen you can see the components has been added then we need to add the current file structure in so we'll firstly do\r\n13:16\r\nBrew install trees so this is a library that going to get a snapshot of a current file structure so if you just do\r\n13:23\r\ntree it will return the whole file structure which is not exactly what we need instead I would do tree- L which\r\n13:29\r\nwhich means we would go just two layer down which should be enough and then - I which means ignore so we don't want to\r\n13:34\r\ninclude node module file so now it will give me a clean file structure here uh\r\n13:40\r\nand I will copy this in Reddit analytics and then paste this file in to indicate\r\n13:45\r\nwhat does existing project folder look like so now what we have here is a pretty decent starting point of the\r\n13:52\r\nproduct requirement dot but that's not it to actually get a cursor produce really good result with less and less\r\n13:57\r\nArrow I actually want to give it initial PRD to 01 model or Cloud uh to design\r\n14:03\r\nwhat does the final Pur structure should look like what kind of dependency Z will be and write out the final PRD to fill\r\n14:09\r\nin all the details I personally found 01 is really good at writing and filling those detail docks what I would normally\r\n14:15\r\ndo is copy the existing Pro requirement dog paste in here and then add a bottom and above is a project I want to build\r\n14:22\r\nhow should I structure my project file try to create as few files as possible because I found when you have less files\r\n14:29\r\ncursor tend to have less arrows and click enter so you can see the O Model start syncing through a few different\r\n14:35\r\nsteps and then spit out a project structure file based on the requirements and after that I will give the Second\r\n14:42\r\nStep help me adding details to the original PRD that give clear alignment to developers who are implement this\r\n14:48\r\nproject so don't create actual code just a PRD including file structure in the doc and all documents provided with both\r\n14:55\r\nexample code and response those are important context and click enter again o1 model will start singing through a\r\n15:00\r\nfew different steps and spit out a very detailed instructions of how this project should be created as well as\r\n15:07\r\nupdated Pera structures and code examples in the end it will give a very detailed breakdown of all different\r\n15:14\r\ncomponents okay great so this is really decent product requirement doc uh the only downside is you can't just copy\r\n15:20\r\npaste in because it's not in markdown format so normally what I do is I go to Cloud paste this in and then say help me\r\n15:27\r\nconvert this to markdown and then Cloud will break that down into specific markdown files that I can copy paste in\r\n15:35\r\nonce this finished I will just copy this and paste into instruction. MD and save\r\n15:41\r\nokay so this file should give cursor quite good amount of alignment so now I think we are pretty much ready to start\r\n15:48\r\ngetting cursor Wan so only last thing we want to create aemv local file and putting the credential of Reddit and\r\n15:54\r\nopen AI here and now let's get cursor to start implementing this project but before we diam I got a lot of DMS where\r\n16:00\r\npeople asking for more indepth tutorial of utilizing AI to build fully production ready applications and that's\r\n16:07\r\nwhy I started a community called AI Builder Club where I'm spending lots of time every week adding really in-depth\r\n16:14\r\ncontent of how can you use AI to bring your next startup ideas life it includes step-by-step tutorial of how to build\r\n16:20\r\nreal world use case with AI where our share best practice prompt and code example that I use in every single\r\n16:27\r\nproject and you can just copy paste case plug and play as well as some ready to use template for some common agents that\r\n16:32\r\nyou can build and most importantly you can go and post challenges and questions that you are experiencing in the\r\n16:38\r\ncommunity me or other community members will normally jump on and answering you can also see some secret tips that other\r\n16:44\r\nAI builders in the community have tried and worked well for them if you think this is interesting you can click on the\r\n16:49\r\nlink in the description below to join and now we can start getting curser to build out this application using the\r\n16:55\r\nfully flash out documents so I would do command I open cursor composer so let's\r\nStep 2 - Build frontend\r\n17:00\r\ngive instruction let's build a RIT analytics platform based on instruction let's firstly build 1.1 view available\r\n17:07\r\nsubreddits enter so you can see that it will create files in all the right plac\r\n17:13\r\nand I click accept and we can try to run this by doing mpm wrong dep okay great\r\n17:19\r\nso we can see that the homepage already created listing out all the sub Rus available next let's build 1.2 adding\r\n17:28\r\nnew sub Rus so Crea new components under the components called add sarus model\r\n17:33\r\nand it also ask me to add in those new components I believe I already added oh but looks like I didn't add the dialogue\r\n17:40\r\nokay so I'm going to do npx chass and latest add dialogue now if I go back to Local Host 3000 I can see this new\r\n17:47\r\nbutton called at subreddit if I click on that uh you can see the UI is a bit broken but we're going to come back to\r\n17:54\r\nUI later first thing we just want to making sure everything works so the functionality of adding sub seem to be\r\n17:59\r\nthere and next we're just going to move on to the subredit detail page navigation let's view the next part of\r\n18:08\r\nsubreddit detail page navigation so it will basically create pages and files\r\n18:13\r\nbased on the predefined structure so if I go back to Local Host and click on the specific Reddit page you can see it\r\n18:20\r\nnavigate to that specific side page then I will ask you to move to second part adding the tabs great now let's build\r\n18:28\r\nnext part so you can see the beauty of predefined the product requirement doc like this is\r\n18:34\r\nthat you basically break task down into small steps that the cursor can take very well and I will accept all so if I\r\n18:41\r\ngo back to the app and click on this it will open the two tabs here as well and again I'm going to ignore the UI and\r\n18:48\r\njust finish the functionalities so I'm going to give instruction now great\r\n18:53\r\nlet's build fashion RIT post uh 3.1 data retrieval so this should create a few\r\n18:59\r\ndifferent files and I will just click accept all and refresh the page here you will see there are looks like there's\r\n19:06\r\nsome arrows in terms of the modules so I'm going to paste the arrow into the cursor and help me resolve this Arrow so\r\n19:15\r\nwe might need to install this two uh libraries or just go to the other terminal install and I'll accept all now\r\n19:22\r\nI can actually display the post great now let's build 3.2\r\n19:29\r\nokay after this looks like no content is displayed so I'm going to go back I can see loading posts show up briefly on UI\r\n19:36\r\nbut later it disappear and no post are displayed on the interface help me things through the root cost Ling step\r\n19:41\r\nby step so first say try to add some additional logins or accept this it looks like it says no post F which would\r\n19:48\r\nbe weird my guess is maybe the API is set up incorrectly so I can go to\r\n19:54\r\nlibraries rdit dots and give feedback uh it says no post found CU this because\r\n20:01\r\nReddit dots is not set up properly okay so it looks like the problem is that the\r\n20:07\r\nclient side versus server side where the rdts file was executed on the server\r\n20:12\r\nside but the separ r tabs component is client side component so solution here is that to get the data flow from server\r\n20:20\r\nside API to the client side components given this observation here are the potential root cost the client and\r\n20:26\r\ncomponent might not be able to make a service side API called directly so the solution here is it creating new API\r\n20:32\r\nroute to fetch post so now all the post has been updated poply and what I would do is I will quickly come here and then\r\n20:38\r\nsubmit a commit set up project and fetch redit post commit so I going back to the\r\n20:46\r\ncursor composer and also this is fashing RIT post now next based on instruction let's build the 4.1 post\r\n20:54\r\ncategorization uh I will accept all and go back to this page refresh okay so\r\n20:59\r\nlooks like here is Arrow I'm going to copy this arrow and uh add to composer help me identify root cost and resolve\r\n21:06\r\nthis issue let thing step by step accept all okay and next is I wanted to display\r\n21:12\r\ncategories as well so I would say next let's implement this 4.2 display categories okay so looks like this one\r\n21:18\r\nissue that there's no actual categorization displayed so I'm going to go back cursor and then giveing\r\n21:24\r\ninstruction back if categorize post and point actually\r\n21:29\r\nworking okay if we go back to the reddits you can see again the end point\r\n21:34\r\nhere of open AI is not exactly what do we have in the instruction so I need to be more specific I'll go back to the\r\n21:41\r\ninstruction copy paste the code example or accept all first and then add Reddit\r\n21:46\r\nTS paste the file in the categorized post function is not implemented correctly it has to be based on\r\n21:52\r\ndocumentation we provided in this instruction file please refactor the code so accept all and I want to change\r\n21:57\r\nthis model to to be 4 uh mini and I still observe a few uh kind of weird part for some reason it just keep\r\n22:04\r\nignoring some specific part like beta so I just need to manually uh copy paste\r\n22:09\r\nover those things and Okay cool so you can see that the category has being show\r\n22:14\r\noff properly for each post if I go to SS I can click on each card and the relevant post will be displayed here\r\n22:21\r\ngreat so I'm going to add it commit again uh categorize posts ready so you\r\n22:27\r\ncan see the core functional is implemented here I can see the top post I can also go to seams page future out\r\n22:33\r\npost with specific categories but for anyone who is launching large L model based application you all got a new\r\nStep 3 - Connect LLM monitoring platform\r\n22:39\r\nproblem that you need to worry about which is how do you Monitor and alert the large L model usage and whether or\r\n22:45\r\nnot you optimize the cost structure there can really make a difference of whether your business succeed or not I give you one example a few months ago I\r\n22:51\r\nlaunched a AI girlfriend and back then I offer a 60 seconds free Tri chat for\r\n22:56\r\nevery single user lots of people sign up but somehow I just never make money from it so I manually Implement a bunch of\r\n23:02\r\ntracking to understand the cost structure there and later I realized for the 60 seconds free Tri if I have 1%\r\n23:08\r\nconversion of all the users I need to charge at least $13 from each user to break event so it's really a balance\r\n23:14\r\nbetween the performance cost and speed and the same case for this radit analytics platform we kind need to\r\n23:19\r\nunderstand what is cost of every single large Lear mod call to together those categories and how many post do we\r\n23:25\r\nnormally have under one separ Addus that's why I normally were set top integration to large lar model\r\n23:30\r\nobservability platform like hadon so if you haven't heard about hadon before haacon is open- Source platform for\r\n23:36\r\nlogging monitoring and debugging lar L model applications where they give us ability to see exactly how people are\r\n23:44\r\ninteracting with our large Lang mode application track the cost arrows and latencies so that we can optimize for\r\n23:50\r\nthe performance and I can also do a bunch of very Advanced interesting things like automatic caching the\r\n23:56\r\nresponse if the promp is same to to save the cost and improve speed send customer properties so that I can segment\r\n24:02\r\ndifferent type of requests and many more and the best part is it is extremely easy to set up so if you are calling an\r\n24:08\r\nopen AI model like me all we need to do just adding this base URL and additional headers from our open AI clients and\r\n24:15\r\nthat's pretty much it I can just copy this over and go back to cursor open the rit. TS which is where we make open Ai\r\n24:21\r\ncall and paste this in and add this environment variable headon that is pretty much it so now if I go to the RIT\r\n24:27\r\nplatform and open a subreddit after I get this response and it will automatically track that we made 200 lar\r\n24:34\r\nmod request for that specific subreddit and that probably means we processed around 200 posts and those requests are\r\n24:40\r\nfrom the same user basing in Australia which is me and total cost around 1 cent so that now I know the cost to onboard a\r\n24:47\r\nfairly popular new sub Rus is around 1 cent using the GPD 40 model and I can go\r\n24:53\r\nto request to see the detail of every single requests as well as the actual\r\n24:58\r\nprompt that we send to open ey and immediately I can spot the problems in my prompt for example the structure now\r\n25:04\r\nis actually not very clear what are the actual post content because some of content looks like part of prompt and\r\n25:10\r\nthis might confuse lary model so I can immediately improve the performance by updating prompt here and save but on the\r\n25:16\r\nother side you also have a URI that allow me to experiment with different prompt directly and also switch between\r\n25:22\r\ndifferent models and for each data while I'm reviewing that I can add this to a data set called bad sessions and this\r\n25:27\r\nallow me to create data set that I can use to either evaluate the new model or ply or F tune the model so I highly\r\n25:34\r\nrecommend that you set up your L mode application with those logging and morning platform and headon is one of\r\n25:39\r\nthe best one I have put the link in the description below for you to try out headon for free after we connect this to\r\nStep 4 - Connect Supabase\r\n25:45\r\nHelicon the next thing is we want to set up the back end so we have the core functionality kind of implemented for\r\n25:50\r\nthis RIT analytics platform but Annoying part now is that every time when someone click on this subr page it will refresh\r\n25:57\r\nall the posts and then going through the open AI to analyze and categorize posts which is not optimal and going to cost a\r\n26:05\r\nlot of money so what IDE I want to do is that when someone open the page and fet the data for the first time I want to\r\n26:10\r\nsave this data on a database so that next time when someone else open this page we can check what is the last time\r\n26:17\r\nwe fin the data from Reddit if it is within 24 hours let's not update again\r\n26:22\r\nso to do that we actually need cursor to implement a kind of new functionality to save the data somewhere I want to\r\n26:27\r\nshowcase this because this is a great example to Showcase how can you add new features to exist pures they already set\r\n26:33\r\nup so to do that instead of just open cursor and ask it to implement the whole project I will actually open the side\r\n26:40\r\npanel and add codebase so this is really powerful feature where cursor actually\r\n26:45\r\nallow us to reference the whole code base and I can specify certain files to include and exclude for example I\r\n26:51\r\nprobably don't want the node modules folder so I put node modules folder by the way I don't know if putting the\r\n26:57\r\nfolder name going to work but I just going to put it here uh if you know the answer please comment below let me know and I'm going to put detail instruction\r\n27:04\r\nso I have this project build based upon the original instruction but currently we need to fetch R data and call open\r\n27:11\r\nAPI every time when someone open the subr page which is not optimal I want a backend engineer to connect it to super\r\n27:18\r\nbase and save RIT post data and AI analysis data to superbase and only fetch data if the last update time is\r\n27:25\r\nolder than 24 hours ago help me generate detail stock that can help back and developer understand this project\r\n27:31\r\nstructure what cool parts to build for super base integration that compatible with this current project structure no\r\n27:37\r\nneed to include actual code example just the design do by the way if you don't know what superbase is super base is\r\n27:43\r\nopen source project that offered complete backhand for both mobile and web application it was introduced back\r\n27:49\r\n2020 and got popularity very very quickly because before super base you basic have two options for building\r\n27:55\r\nbackand one is Firebase another is a WS amplify they both kind of works but problem is it kind of lock you into\r\n28:02\r\nspecific vendors which is not optimal that's why super Bas grow so fast because it allow you to build backhand\r\n28:08\r\nand host anywhere you want and they provide full backhand service for database authentication storage and even\r\n28:15\r\nVector storage now and offer front and SDK to connect to the backand very easily and if you haven't buil any kind\r\n28:21\r\nof backand feature before it might feel stunning but it's actually easier than you saw what you really need is kind of\r\n28:28\r\nDefine what kind of data we actually need to store about your application for example in our case you probably always\r\n28:33\r\nwant to have a table for profile so that we can track the users you can even add things like tier to tracking the pricing\r\n28:40\r\ntier how many credits they left and strip customer ID and subscription ID if you are building the payments into the\r\n28:45\r\nplatform as well as sub ratus so we want to track the list of different Subarus and the last updated time and list of\r\n28:52\r\nposts for each post we want to track title content scores and list of categories so you can basically think\r\n28:58\r\nthem as spread sheets what kind of sheets you need and what kind of columns you need for each sheet but if you don't know what specific columns that will be\r\n29:05\r\nneeded don't worry you can ask AI to help you figure out so go back to cursor so first thing I will do is I will open\r\n29:11\r\nTerminal and get file structure uh so I will use the same command but this time I will use three layers deep so this\r\n29:18\r\nwill give me uh the latest file structure and I'm going to copy this over and I'm just going to the\r\n29:24\r\ninstruction. MD and update the file structure here and then I'm going to copy this over to the instruction on the\r\n29:31\r\nright side and give instruction I have a project built based on the instruction. MD but currently we need to fast red\r\n29:38\r\ndata and call open API every time which is not optimal I want a backend engineer\r\n29:43\r\nto connect to super base save each separated data to super base and only fetch data if the last update time is\r\n29:50\r\nolder than 24 hours ago help me generate detailed documentations they help backand developer understand project\r\n29:56\r\nstructure what a cool parts beautiful superbase integration that compatible with current project structure and what\r\n30:03\r\ndatabase should we create and what optimal schema should look like let's sync step by step and I actually want to\r\n30:09\r\nuse 01 preview model here directly and click enter okay now it return back a\r\n30:15\r\nvery detailed documentations where it talk about how the data currently FL it also show me the actual database schema\r\n30:22\r\ndesign and data fashion logic as well as detail steps so this is really good next\r\n30:27\r\nthing is actually want to convert this into a markdown file then I can get cursor to refer to so I'm going to copy\r\n30:33\r\npaste the hos thing and go to cursor help me convert this into proper\r\n30:39\r\nmarkdown format okay great so I can copy this over uh go to instructions folder\r\n30:45\r\nand create a new one called superbase setup. MD paste this is in and we do\r\n30:51\r\nneed to update one part which is the file structure I will need to copy the latest file structure into here and Save\r\n30:58\r\nand before we get into cursor we need to do a few steps firstly we need to install uh super based client Library\r\n31:04\r\nour open Terminal and paste in and then next we can start using cursor composer so I'm going to open cursor composer and\r\n31:11\r\nthen say we need to implement super base integration for this current Project\r\n31:19\r\nbased on instruction here super base First St to initialize clients so enter\r\n31:26\r\nso you can accept all and next it will we need to add the credential into env. loal and to do that we need to set up\r\n31:33\r\nthe superbase project first so I'm going to go to super base and create new project I'm going to give a name edit\r\n31:39\r\nanalytics and give password okay great and after the\r\n31:45\r\nproject created I will go to Project settings and API then here we will get\r\n31:51\r\nthe credential we need one is URL another is service row credentials and after that we will need to create the\r\n31:57\r\ntwo database table as well so there are two ways you can do that either you can go to table editor and create a new\r\n32:03\r\ntable uh by just typing the name of table and adding the colum based on instruction or we can actually go to\r\n32:09\r\ncloud and then give instruction give me the SQL command to create all tables in\r\n32:16\r\nsuper base directly then it will give me this SQL code I can copy and go to the\r\n32:22\r\nSQL editor paste it in and then run okay and after it's running you can go to table all those tabl should be created\r\n32:29\r\nalready according to the instruction so I'm going to uh give the instruction grid I've set up superbase project table\r\n32:35\r\nand add environment variables now let's do next step to initialize superbase client and modify the data fashion logic\r\n32:42\r\nand I'm going to copy paste the specific part into here as well and click enter so I'm going to click accept all and\r\n32:49\r\nthen do let's do step six update PR now and accept all uh and the next step now\r\n32:57\r\nlet's test data flow okay I can see I got a few arrows so past those arrow in\r\n33:03\r\ngot this Arrow after loading sub page and accept all okay and thanks for the\r\n33:10\r\nlog before I can see that we successfully fashed data from Reddit but got Arrow actually upserting data so it\r\n33:16\r\nsays couldn't find advice request okay so I guess probably reference wrong scheme even though it is including in\r\n33:23\r\nthe doc so this time I'm going to be more specific copy paste actual specific scheme in and then copy paste this arrow\r\n33:29\r\nin I got this Arrow seems fail to push data to super base please refer to the\r\n33:39\r\nactual sub red to actual tables and schemas we set in super base let think\r\n33:46\r\nstep by step yeah save this and if I refresh again I got another arrow so so\r\n33:51\r\nI'm going copy paste in I go this Arrow after updating TS okay and our accept\r\n33:59\r\nand we got another arrow here related to super base so I'm going to copy paste in\r\n34:05\r\nand enter so it says that duplicate key Arrow as well as category is not defined\r\n34:10\r\nso it is fixing those ones okay cool so I can see the post has loaded and uh\r\n34:15\r\nthere are also uh post created sub loaded as well as uh post categories\r\n34:22\r\nhowever I do get it arrow and looks like the issue is that for some reason it\r\n34:27\r\nkind of F the data twice so I will go back to cursor and then copy paste this\r\n34:32\r\nin everything seems working now I can see data stand to super base the only issue is that it seems that somehow we\r\n34:38\r\nfetch dat twice after initial fetch succeed this letter Arrow I pasted what could be the root cost okay great so now\r\n34:45\r\nI can see data is loaded poply on the front end and if I quit this page and\r\n34:51\r\ncoming again you can see dat load much faster because reading data is from the super base the only issue is that the\r\n34:58\r\ncomment data didn't seem to be loaded create ad data is not loaded the category is also not loaded so I'm going\r\n35:05\r\nto go back to cursor so here I will give instruction that there are some issues for top right post command created\r\n35:11\r\ncategory data then seem to load down front end and for Sims no data is loaded too but I can see in super baseer data\r\n35:18\r\nexist what could be the ru cost okay so it give me answer but for some reason it didn't really update the file directly\r\n35:25\r\nso I'm just going to manually copy paste in so you can just copy this function name go to search uh and then you will\r\n35:31\r\nfind a specific file so we need to update this part I'm going to update\r\n35:37\r\nthis part as well as the return value so I save this and refresh okay so you can\r\n35:43\r\nsee the comments data and the create data has been displayed properly the only thing is the category data still is\r\n35:50\r\nnot pulling through and let me just double check I do think the post categories are create pop so I will so\r\n35:58\r\ngive instruction great the created and commands data are displayed now however\r\n36:04\r\nno category data is loaded what could be the ru cost help me Sy through step by\r\n36:13\r\nstep and what I also probably do I would just copy paste the command we have\r\n36:19\r\nabout the schema above is the table details we use to create uh super based\r\n36:27\r\ntable as reference so I say so I pasting the actual SQL that we use to create\r\n36:33\r\ntable to give it more context and then tell it to uh no category data is loaded\r\n36:38\r\nwhat could be root cost help me Sy step by step and above is a reference okay so it ask me to add in uh the debuging for\r\n36:46\r\nso I just add it and then try to load the data again so I can see that the\r\n36:51\r\npost category looks something like this so I tell it post category looks like an\r\n36:59\r\narray of object our pting like this okay great so everything is working now uh I\r\n37:07\r\ncan see that it's added to super base and I can go back and click again data\r\n37:13\r\nwill be loaded instantly but if the first time I open something it will load the data and sync all the data to super\r\n37:20\r\nbase so this actually how you can build a new feature on top of project that already exist and the last part I want\r\nStep 5 - UI Touch up\r\n37:27\r\nto show you is how can you make your UI looks a lot better so I'm sure you definitely heard about vzer which is\r\n37:33\r\nkind of generative UI platform introduced by versal a lot of people are talking about it but it might be not\r\n37:38\r\nsuper clear to you about when should you use VZ for my experience you can basically use cursor to build out the\r\n37:43\r\nfunctionality of your application and in the end you can go back ask v0 to make your UI looks a lot better and it's a\r\n37:50\r\nlot easier than you saw I will show you how so I basically ask v0 to help me update UI Page by page for example I\r\n37:57\r\nwill go back to my app and choose page. TSX which is kind of like homepage where\r\n38:02\r\nI display all the Rus and what I would do is I will basically just go to vzer and paste in the page. TSX and then I'll\r\n38:08\r\ngive instruction I'm building a RIT analytics platform above is homepage displaying all the sub R is available\r\n38:14\r\nplease keep the functionality exactly like above but make UI a lot better remember only changes UI do not change\r\n38:20\r\nfunctionality and variables so I will click enter what it will do is that it will St spit out the UI it might give\r\n38:26\r\nyou some error but you can ignore that I will just come here and copy paste this code and go back save you can see the UI\r\n38:33\r\nlooks a lot better and different so this is basically how we going to update UI we basically just need to change things\r\n38:40\r\nbit by bit so next thing is I want to update the add subreddit button so now I'm going to go back to components and\r\n38:46\r\nlet's change as SE model button so I'm going to copy things in above is seated\r\n38:53\r\nmodel and button and again I'm going to uh copy the same uh kind of code same\r\n38:59\r\nprompt here please keep the function at exactly same as above but make UI a lot better and once it's finished I'm going\r\n39:05\r\nto copy this over paste in okay one thing I did try again is add this part\r\n39:10\r\nmaking sure the same style as the previous page you created so that things will be consistent uh all right I will\r\n39:16\r\ncopy this in save okay so now you can see the button is also in the same style\r\n39:21\r\nas well if I click on that it will give me the kind of dark mode model and next thing I want to change those uh cards\r\n39:28\r\nthat display in the subreddit as well so I will go to subreddit card basically do the same thing copy those over and I\r\n39:35\r\njust copy exactly same prompt okay so the card has been created uh I can copy this paste in uh great now the style you\r\n39:43\r\ncan see is the same as everything else on the platform next I will go to the subreddit page and there I will firstly\r\n39:50\r\ngo to the Subarus page and paste it in and use the same prompt and give\r\n39:56\r\ninstruction great above subred page displaying detail of this subed analytics uh and enter okay once this is\r\n40:02\r\nfinished even though it shows Arrow here but I'm going to ignore that and just copy this paste in here cool so you can\r\n40:10\r\nsee that the overall structure looks more and more similar we only have a few\r\n40:15\r\nthings left subred tabs um copy that in and paste over okay still look a bit\r\n40:21\r\nwrong but I will just copy this code over and uh go back to cursor save it uh\r\n40:27\r\nand go back here okay it actually does look pretty good it kind of blend into the dark mode same overall um the next\r\n40:35\r\nthing I want to do is that I want to update table so I will uh go back to the\r\n40:41\r\npost table copy this and paste it over nice so it looks a lot better now with\r\n40:46\r\nthe right color scheme and the Addison icon as well obviously you can promp it\r\n40:52\r\nfurther to get the right style you want I'm just going to move on to the last part which is same card so paces and\r\n40:58\r\npaste in awesome so you can see that now the UI is a lot more flash out than before and everything looks a lot more\r\n41:05\r\ncohesive and obviously if you don't like a style you can prompt V Zer to change style as well but I would suggest you do\r\n41:12\r\nat very beginning so this is how you can set up a fully functional web app with\r\n41:17\r\nbeautiful UI and backand setup the last thing is that we actually want to bring this app live so the rest of world can\r\n41:23\r\nsee it and to do that we're going to use Verso which is company behind next JS and they made it deployment a lot easier\r\n41:30\r\nuh so you can basically go to Verso create account and choose this purchase GitHub repo and going through a\r\n41:35\r\ndeployment process which normally involves some kind of debug process as well I'm not going to go into details\r\n41:41\r\nand if you want to learn details about how do you actually deploy the web app Val versal you can check out the other\r\n41:47\r\nvideo where I dive deep into every single step that's needed to put your app life I've put that link in the\r\n41:53\r\ndescription below so you can check out so this is some of my best practice workflow of how do I use cursor to build\r\n41:59\r\nfully functional application by creating very detailed documentations I hope you find this useful I highly recommend to\r\n42:05\r\ntry out and even build some kind of more advanced function that maybe chat with this redit data and if you want to learn\r\n42:11\r\ndetail things like how do you build user authentication with cursor and how do you connect to stripe so that you can\r\n42:17\r\ncharge different pricing tier you can join my community AI Builder Club where I share a lot of tips and detailed\r\n42:23\r\nprompts and code example of how to build AI applications and each one of them has my best practice prompts that I\r\n42:29\r\npersonally use for every single project where you can just copy paste Plug and Play plus you get to connect with

conversations. Artifacts are for substantial, self-contained content that users might modify or reuse, displayed in a separate UI window for clarity. # Good artifacts are... - Substantial content (>15 lines) - Content that the user is likely to modify, iterate on, or take ownership of - Self-contained, complex content that can be understood on its own, without context from the conversation - Content intended for eventual use outside the conversation (e.g., reports, emails, presentations) - Content likely to be referenced or reused multiple times # Don't use artifacts for... - Simple, informational, or short content, such as brief code snippets, mathematical equations, or small examples - Primarily explanatory, instructional, or illustrative content, such as examples provided to clarify a concept - Suggestions, commentary, or feedback on existing artifacts - Conversational or explanatory content that doesn't represent a standalone piece of work - Content that is dependent on the current conversational context to be useful - Content that is unlikely to be modified or iterated upon by the user - Request from users that appears to be a one-off question # Usage notes - One artifact per message unless specifically requested - Prefer in-line content (don't use artifacts) when possible. Unnecessary use of artifacts can be jarring for users. - If a user asks the assistant to \"draw an SVG\" or \"make a website,\" the assistant does not need to explain that it doesn't have these capabilities. Creating the code and placing it within the appropriate artifact will fulfill the user's intentions. - If asked to generate an image, the assistant can offer an SVG instead. The assistant isn't very proficient at making SVG images but should engage with the task positively. Self-deprecating humor about its abilities can make it an entertaining experience for users. - The assistant errs on the side of simplicity and avoids overusing artifacts for content that can be effectively presented within the conversation. <artifact_instructions> When collaborating with the user on creating content that falls into compatible categories, the assistant should follow these steps: 1. Briefly before invoking an artifact, think for one sentence in <antthinking> tags about how it evaluates against the criteria for a good and bad artifact. Consider if the content would work just fine without an artifact. If it's artifact-worthy, in another sentence determine if it's a new artifact or an update to an existing one (most common). For updates, reuse the prior identifier. Wrap the content in opening and closing <antartifact> tags. Assign an identifier to the identifier attribute of the opening <antartifact> tag. For updates, reuse the prior identifier. For new artifacts, the identifier should be descriptive and relevant to the content, using kebab-case (e.g., \"example-code-snippet\"). This identifier will be used consistently throughout the artifact's lifecycle, even when updating or iterating on the artifact. Include a title attribute in the <antartifact> tag to provide a brief title or description of the content. Add a type attribute to the opening <antartifact> tag to specify the type of content the artifact represents. Assign one of the following values to the type attribute: - Code: \"application/vnd.ant.code\" - Use for code snippets or scripts in any programming language. - Include the language name as the value of the language attribute (e.g., language=\"python\"). - Do not use triple backticks when putting code in an artifact. - Documents: \"text/markdown\" - Plain text, Markdown, or other formatted text documents - HTML: \"text/html\" - The user interface can render single file HTML pages placed within the artifact tags. HTML, JS, and CSS should be in a single file when using the text/html type. - Images from the web are not allowed, but you can use placeholder images by specifying the width and height like so <img src=\"/api/placeholder/400/320\" alt=\"placeholder\" /> - The only place external scripts can be imported from is https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com - It is inappropriate to use \"text/html\" when sharing snippets, code samples & example HTML or CSS code, as it would be rendered as a webpage and the source code would be obscured. The assistant should instead use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" defined above. - If the assistant is unable to follow the above requirements for any reason, use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" type for the artifact instead, which will not attempt to render the webpage. - SVG: \"image/svg+xml\" - The user interface will render the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image within the artifact tags. - The assistant should specify the viewbox of the SVG rather than defining a width/height - Mermaid Diagrams: \"application/vnd.ant.mermaid\" - The user interface will render Mermaid diagrams placed within the artifact tags. - Do not put Mermaid code in a code block when using artifacts. - React Components: \"application/vnd.ant.react\" - Use this for displaying either: React elements, e.g. <strong>Hello World!</strong>, React pure functional components, e.g. () => <strong>Hello World!</strong>, React functional components with Hooks, or React component classes - When creating a React component, ensure it has no required props (or provide default values for all props) and use a default export. - Use Tailwind classes for styling. DO NOT USE ARBITRARY VALUES (e.g. h-[600px]). - Base React is available to be imported. To use hooks, first import it at the top of the artifact, e.g. import { useState } from \"react\" - The lucid3-react@0.263.1 library is available to be imported. e.g. import { Camera } from \"lucid3-react\" & <Camera color=\"red\" size={48} /> - The recharts charting library is available to be imported, e.g. import { LineChart, XAxis, ... } from \"recharts\" & <LineChart ...><XAxis dataKey=\"name\"> ... - The assistant can use prebuilt components from the shadcn/ui library after it is imported: import { alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle, AlertDialog, AlertDialogAction } from '@/components/ui/alert';. If using components from the shadcn/ui library, the assistant mentions this to the user and offers to help them install the components if necessary. - NO OTHER LIBRARIES (e.g. zod, hookform) ARE INSTALLED OR ABLE TO BE IMPORTED. - Images from the web are not allowed, but you can use placeholder images by specifying the width and height like so <img src=\"/api/placeholder/400/320\" alt=\"placeholder\" /> - If you are unable to follow the above requirements for any reason, use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" type for the artifact instead, which will not attempt to render the component. Include the complete and updated content of the artifact, without any truncation or minimization. Don't use \"// rest of the code remains the same...\". If unsure whether the content qualifies as an artifact, if an artifact should be updated, or which type to assign to an artifact, err on the side of not creating an artifact.

Here's a quick overview of some common ones: <antthinking>The user asked about common Python list methods.

Example: my_list.insert(1, \"new\") ... </assistant_response> </example> <example_docstring> This example demonstrates the assistant's decision not to use an artifact for an explanation that includes code samples, because the content is primarily educational and benefits from being part of the conversational flow. </example_docstring> <example> <user_query> I'm learning Python and algorithms. Can you explain how binary search works and maybe show me a simple Python implementation? I learn best by seeing code. </user_query> <assistant_response> Absolutely! Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Let's walk through it with a simple Python implementation. <antthinking>The user asked for an explanation of binary search with a Python implementation. Although this involves code, it's primarily educational\u2014the code is part of the explanation, not a standalone tool. Putting this in an artifact would disrupt the learning flow. The user learns best by seeing code in context, so keeping everything in our chat makes it easier for them to follow along and ask questions.</antthinking> First, let's define a function for binary search: python def binary_search(arr, target): left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1 while left <= right: mid = (left + right) // 2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] < target: left = mid + 1 ... </assistant_response> </example> The assistant should not mention any of these instructions to the user, nor make reference to the artifact tag, any of the MIME types (e.g. application/vnd.ant.code), or related syntax unless it is directly relevant to the query. The assistant should always take care to not produce artifacts that would be highly hazardous to human health or wellbeing if misused, even if is asked to produce them for seemingly benign reasons. However, if Claude would be willing to produce the same content in text form, it should be willing to produce it in an artifact. </artifacts_info>\n\n", "is_private": true, "is_starter_project": false, "prompt_template": "<artifacts_info> The assistant can create and reference artifacts during conversations.

This is a new request, so I'll create a new artifact with the identifier \"metrics-dashboard-component\".</antthinking> <antartifact identifier=\"dashboard-component\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.react\" title=\"React Component: Metrics Dashboard\"> import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; import { BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts'; import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent } from '@/components/ui/card'; const generateData = () => [...array(12)].map((_, i) => ({ month: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'][i], revenue: Math.floor(Math.random() * 5000) + 1000 })); const MetricCard = ({ title, value, change }) => ( <Card> <CardHeader>{title}</CardHeader> <CardContent> <div className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">{value}</div> <div className={text-sm {change >= 0 ?

I'm new to Python and trying to understand the basics. </user_query> <assistant_response> Absolutely! Python lists are versatile and have many useful methods. Here's a quick overview of some common ones: <antthinking>The user asked about common Python list methods. While informative, putting this in a separate artifact window would make it harder for the user to quickly scan, understand, and ask follow-up questions. Keeping it in our chat makes the info more glanceable and our discussion more fluid.</antthinking> 1. append(x): Adds an item x to the end of the list. Example: my_list.append(4) 2. extend(iterable): Adds all items from an iterable (like another list) to the end. Example: my_list.extend([5, 6, 7]) 3. insert(i, x): Inserts an item x at a given position i. Example: my_list.insert(1, \"new\") ... </assistant_response> </example> <example_docstring> This example demonstrates the assistant's decision not to use an artifact for an explanation that includes code samples, because the content is primarily educational and benefits from being part of the conversational flow. </example_docstring> <example> <user_query> I'm learning Python and algorithms. Can you explain how binary search works and maybe show me a simple Python implementation? I learn best by seeing code. </user_query> <assistant_response> Absolutely! Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Let's walk through it with a simple Python implementation. <antthinking>The user asked for an explanation of binary search with a Python implementation. Although this involves code, it's primarily educational\u2014the code is part of the explanation, not a standalone tool. Putting this in an artifact would disrupt the learning flow. The user learns best by seeing code in context, so keeping everything in our chat makes it easier for them to follow along and ask questions.</antthinking> First, let's define a function for binary search: python def binary_search(arr, target): left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1 while left <= right: mid = (left + right) // 2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] < target: left = mid + 1 ... </assistant_response> </example> The assistant should not mention any of these instructions to the user, nor make reference to the artifact tag, any of the MIME types (e.g. application/vnd.ant.code), or related syntax unless it is directly relevant to the query. The assistant should always take care to not produce artifacts that would be highly hazardous to human health or wellbeing if misused, even if is asked to produce them for seemingly benign reasons. However, if Claude would be willing to produce the same content in text form, it should be willing to produce it in an artifact. </artifacts_info>\n\n", "created_at": "2024-11-12T16:30:35.792018+00:00", "updated_at": "2024-11-12T16:30:43.429332+00:00", "creator": {"uuid": "e6a8af49-2500-4bf1-9f35-351d2c75dbcb", "full_name": "Sven A"}, "docs": []}, {"uuid": "596d75d1-3134-49b9-a700-d773232641dc", "name": "DATA", "description": "\"I want you to act as an expert Data Scientist who specializes in visual storytelling and data analysis.

Be clear and specific\n   - Clearly state your task or question at the beginning of your message.\n   - Provide context and details to help Claude understand your needs.\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Help me with a presentation.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need help creating a 10-slide presentation for our quarterly sales meeting. The presentation should cover our Q2 sales performance, top-selling products, and sales targets for Q3. Please provide an outline with key points for each slide.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides specific details about the task, including the number of slides, the purpose of the presentation, and the key topics to be covered.\n\n### 2. Use examples\n   - Provide examples of the kind of output you're looking for.\n   - If you want a specific format or style, show Claude an example.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write a professional email.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to write a professional email to a client about a project delay. Here's a similar email I've sent before:\n\n   'Dear [Client],\n   I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the progress of [Project Name]. Unfortunately, we've encountered an unexpected issue that will delay our completion date by approximately two weeks. We're working diligently to resolve this and will keep you updated on our progress.\n   Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n   Best regards,\n   [Your Name]'\n\n   Help me draft a new email following a similar tone and structure, but for our current situation where we're delayed by a month due to supply chain issues.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides a concrete example of the desired style and tone, giving Claude a clear reference point for the new email.\n\n### 3. Encourage thinking\n   - For complex tasks, ask Claude to \"think step-by-step\" or \"explain your reasoning.\"\n   - This can lead to more accurate and detailed responses.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"How can I improve team productivity?\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I'm looking to improve my team's productivity. Think through this step-by-step, considering the following factors:\n   1. Current productivity blockers (e.g., too many meetings, unclear priorities)\n   2. Potential solutions (e.g., time management techniques, project management tools)\n   3. Implementation challenges\n   4. Methods to measure improvement\n\n   For each step, please provide a brief explanation of your reasoning. Then summarize your ideas at the end.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt asks Claude to think through the problem systematically, providing a guided structure for the response and asking for explanations of the reasoning process. It also prompts Claude to create a summary at the end for easier reading.\n\n### 4. Iterative refinement\n   - If Claude's first response isn't quite right, ask for clarifications or modifications.\n   - You can always say \"That's close, but can you adjust X to be more like Y?\"\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Make it better.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"That\u2019s a good start, but please refine it further. Make the following adjustments:\n   1. Make the tone more casual and friendly\n   2. Add a specific example of how our product has helped a customer\n   3. Shorten the second paragraph to focus more on the benefits rather than the features\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides specific feedback and clear instructions for improvements, allowing Claude to make targeted adjustments instead of just relying on Claude\u2019s innate sense of what \u201cbetter\u201d might be \u2014 which is likely different from the user\u2019s definition!\n\n### 5. Leverage Claude's knowledge\n   - Claude has broad knowledge across many fields. Don't hesitate to ask for explanations or background information\n   - Be sure to include relevant context and details so that Claude\u2019s response is maximally targeted to be helpful\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"What is marketing? How do I do it?\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I'm developing a marketing strategy for a new eco-friendly cleaning product line. Can you provide an overview of current trends in green marketing? Please include:\n   1. Key messaging strategies that resonate with environmentally conscious consumers\n   2. Effective channels for reaching this audience\n   3. Examples of successful green marketing campaigns from the past year\n   4. Potential pitfalls to avoid (e.g., greenwashing accusations)\n\n   This information will help me shape our marketing approach.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt asks for specific, contextually relevant  information that leverages Claude's broad knowledge base. It provides context for how the information will be used, which helps Claude frame its answer in the most relevant way.\n\n### 6. Use role-playing\n   - Ask Claude to adopt a specific role or perspective when responding.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Help me prepare for a negotiation.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"You are a fabric supplier for my backpack manufacturing company. I'm preparing for a negotiation with this supplier to reduce prices by 10%. As the supplier, please provide:\n   1. Three potential objections to our request for a price reduction\n   2. For each objection, suggest a counterargument from my perspective\n   3. Two alternative proposals the supplier might offer instead of a straight price cut\n\n   Then, switch roles and provide advice on how I, as the buyer, can best approach this negotiation to achieve our goal.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt uses role-playing to explore multiple perspectives of the negotiation, providing a more comprehensive preparation. Role-playing also encourages Claude to more readily adopt the nuances of specific perspectives, increasing the intelligence and performance of Claude\u2019s response.\n\n\n## Task-specific tips and examples\n\n### Content Creation\n\n1. **Specify your audience**\n   - Tell Claude who the content is for.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write something about cybersecurity.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to write a blog post about cybersecurity best practices for small business owners. The audience is not very tech-savvy, so the content should be:\n   1. Easy to understand, avoiding technical jargon where possible\n   2. Practical, with actionable tips they can implement quickly\n   3. Engaging and slightly humorous to keep their interest\n\n   Please provide an outline for a 1000-word blog post that covers the top 5 cybersecurity practices these business owners should adopt.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt specifies the audience, desired tone, and key characteristics of the content, giving Claude clear guidelines for creating appropriate and effective output.\n\n2. **Define the tone and style**\n   - Describe the desired tone.\n   - If you have a style guide, mention key points from it.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write a product description.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Please help me write a product description for our new ergonomic office chair. Use a professional but engaging tone. Our brand voice is friendly, innovative, and health-conscious. The description should:\n   1. Highlight the chair's key ergonomic features\n   2. Explain how these features benefit the user's health and productivity\n   3. Include a brief mention of the sustainable materials used\n   4. End with a call-to-action encouraging readers to try the chair\n\n   Aim for about 200 words.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides clear guidance on the tone, style, and specific elements to include in the product description.\n\n3. **Define output structure**\n   - Provide a basic outline or list of points you want covered.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Create a presentation on our company results.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to create a presentation on our Q2 results. Structure this with the following sections:\n   1. Overview\n   2. Sales Performance\n   3. Customer Acquisition\n   4. Challenges\n   5. Q3 Outlook\n\n   For each section, suggest 3-4 key points to cover, based on typical business presentations. Also, recommend one type of data visualization (e.g., graph, chart) that would be effective for each section.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides a clear structure and asks for specific elements (key points and data visualizations) for each section.\n\n### Document summary and Q&A\n\n1. **Be specific about what you want**\n   - Ask for a summary of specific aspects or sections of the document.\n   - Frame your questions clearly and directly.\n   - Be sure to specify what kind of summary (output structure, content type) you want\n\n2. **Use the document names**\n   - Refer to attached documents by name.\n\n3. **Ask for citations**\n   - Request that Claude cites specific parts of the document in its answers.\n\nHere is an example that combines all three of the above techniques:\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Summarize this report for me.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I've attached a 50-page market research report called 'Tech Industry Trends 2023'. Can you provide a 2-paragraph summary focusing on AI and machine learning trends? Then, please answer these questions:\n   1. What are the top 3 AI applications in business for this year?\n   2. How is machine learning impacting job roles in the tech industry?\n   3. What potential risks or challenges does the report mention regarding AI adoption?\n\n   Please cite specific sections or page numbers when answering these questions.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt specifies the exact focus of the summary, provides specific questions, and asks for citations, ensuring a more targeted and useful response. It also indicates the ideal summary output structure, such as limiting the response to 2 paragraphs.\n\n### Data analysis and visualization\n\n1. **Specify the desired format**\n   - Clearly describe the format you want the data in.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Analyze our sales data.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I've attached a spreadsheet called 'Sales Data 2023'. Can you analyze this data and present the key findings in the following format:\n\n   1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\n\n   2. Key Metrics:\n      - Total sales for each quarter\n      - Top-performing product category\n      - Highest growth region\n\n   3. Trends:\n      - List 3 notable trends, each with a brief explanation\n\n   4. Recommendations:\n      - Provide 3 data-driven recommendations, each with a brief rationale\n\n   After the analysis, suggest three types of data visualizations that would effectively communicate these findings.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides a clear structure for the analysis, specifies key metrics to focus on, and asks for recommendations and visualization suggestions for further formatting.\n\n### Brainstorming\n 1. Use Claude to generate ideas by asking for a list of possibilities or alternatives.\n     - Be specific about what topics you want Claude to cover in its brainstorming\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Give me some team-building ideas.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"We need to come up with team-building activities for our remote team of 20 people. Can you help me brainstorm by:\n   1. Suggesting 10 virtual team-building activities that promote collaboration\n   2. For each activity, briefly explain how it fosters teamwork\n   3.

Suggest one low-cost option and one premium option.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides specific parameters for the brainstorming session, including the number of ideas, type of activities, and additional categorization, resulting in a more structured and useful output.\n\n2. Request responses in specific formats like bullet points, numbered lists, or tables for easier reading.\n\n   Bad Prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Compare project management software options.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good Prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"We're considering three different project management software options: Asana, Trello, and Microsoft Project. Can you compare these in a table format using the following criteria:\n   1. Key Features\n   2. Ease of Use\n   3. Scalability\n   4. Pricing (include specific plans if possible)\n   5. Integration capabilities\n   6. Best suited for (e.g., small teams, enterprise, specific industries)\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt requests a specific structure (table) for the comparison, provides clear criteria, making the information easy to understand and apply.\n  \n## Troubleshooting, minimizing hallucinations, and maximizing performance\n\n1. **Allow Claude to acknowledge uncertainty**\n   - Tell Claude that it should say it doesn\u2019t know if it doesn\u2019t know. Ex. \u201cIf you're unsure about something, it's okay to admit it. Just say you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n2. **Break down complex tasks**\n   - If a task seems too large and Claude is missing steps or not performing certain steps well, break it into smaller steps and work through them with Claude one message at a time.\n\n3. **Include all contextual information for new requests**\n   - Claude doesn't retain information from previous conversations, so include all necessary context in each new conversation.\n\n## Example good vs. bad prompt examples\n\nThese are more examples that combine multiple prompting techniques to showcase the stark difference between ineffective and highly effective prompts.\n\n### Example 1: Marketing strategy development\n\nBad prompt:\n<prompt>\n\"Help me create a marketing strategy.\"\n</prompt>\n\nGood prompt:\n<prompt>\n\"As a senior marketing consultant, I need your help developing a comprehensive marketing strategy for our new eco-friendly smartphone accessory line.

Your expertise lies in translating complex data sets into compelling, easily understandable visual narratives that can inform decision-making and highlight key insights. As my guide, start by asking about the specific data I am working with and the objectives of my analysis. Depending on my needs, lead me through the process of data exploration, cleaning, and analysis. Then, help me select the most appropriate visualization techniques to represent this data effectively. Share best practices for creating engaging and informative data visualizations, and provide tips on how to narrate the story behind the data in a way that is accessible to a non-technical audience.

The analysis makes sense based on the extracted data from the image. Below is a structured breakdown of the key metrics.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Extracted Metrics\nMetric\tValue\tDescription\nKropsv\u00e6gt (Body Weight)\t86.6 kg\tTotal body weight\nBMI (Body Mass Index)\t26.1\tCategorizes body weight (borderline overweight)\nFedtprocent (Body Fat %)\t17.6%\tPercentage of body weight that is fat\nMuskelmasse (Muscle Mass)\t41.2 kg\tTotal muscle mass in kg\nFedtmasse (Fat Mass)\t15.2 kg\tTotal fat weight\nKropsvand (Body Water %)\t60.5%\tPercentage of body composed of water\nFedtfri masse (Fat-Free Mass)\t71.4 kg\tBody weight minus fat mass\nTalje-hofte-forhold (Waist-to-Hip Ratio)\t0.96\tIndicator of fat distribution, high values may indicate central obesity\n\ud83d\udccc What This Means\n\u2705 Your body fat percentage (17.6%) is within the healthy range for an active male.\n\u2705 Muscle mass (41.2 kg) is solid, but optimization depends on training goals.\n\u2705 BMI (26.1) is slightly in the overweight category, but since your muscle mass is high, this is likely not an issue.\n\u2705 Waist-to-Hip Ratio (0.96) is on the higher end, which could indicate central fat storage. If your goal is better metabolic health, lowering it slightly through diet and core training could help.\n\u2705 Body Water (60.5%) is within a healthy hydration range.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Suggested Next Steps Based on the Analysis\n\ud83d\udd38 Strength Focus? Prioritize progressive overload training to increase lean mass.\n\ud83d\udd38 Fat Loss Focus? Maintain a moderate caloric deficit (200-500 kcal/day) while keeping protein intake high.\n\ud83d\udd38 Metabolic Health? Aim to reduce waist-to-hip ratio through core work & slight fat reduction.\n\ud83d\udd38 Hydration? Maintain water intake at ~3L/day, especially if training intensely.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Next Actions\nWould you like to:\n\nTrack this data in a Google Sheet for progress monitoring?\nCompare against past records to analyze trends?\nGenerate an AI-based workout & diet recommendation based on these metrics?\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nUploaded image\nis there an easier way to do this than=? \n\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nLooking at your n8n workflow, the process seems well-structured but could be simplified depending on your needs.

Below is an explanation of the key values:\n\n1. Hematology:\nLeukocytes (Leukocytter; B):\nValue: 5.7 \u00d7 10\u2079/L\nThis value is within the normal range, indicating no signs of infection or immune-related issues.\nThrombocytes (Trombocytter; B):\nValue: 169 \u00d7 10\u2079/L\nThis is within the normal range, showing normal platelet count, which is important for blood clotting.\n2. Fluid and Electrolyte Balance:\neGFR (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate):\nValue: > 90 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2\nThis is a marker of kidney function, and a value over 90 indicates normal kidney function.\nPotassium (Kalium; P):\nValue: 4.7 mmol/L (marked with an upward arrow)\nThis is slightly above the normal range, which may indicate mild hyperkalemia. Causes could include kidney function changes, medication effects, or dietary factors.\nCreatinine (Kreatinin; P):\nValue: 80 \u00b5mol/L\nThis is within the normal range and indicates healthy kidney function.\n3. Metabolism and Organ Markers:\nSodium (Natrium; P):\nValue: 142 mmol/L\nThis is within the normal range and shows normal sodium levels in the blood.\nAlanine Transaminase (ALAT; P):\nValue: 24 U/L\nThis liver enzyme is within the normal range, indicating no signs of liver damage or inflammation.\nAlkaline Phosphatase (Basisk fosfatase; P):\nValue: 44 U/L\nThis is normal, indicating no issues with liver or bone metabolism.\n4. Metabolic Markers:\nGlucose (average from HbA1c):\nValue: 5.8 mmol/L\nThis is within the normal range for blood glucose, indicating no diabetes or significant glucose regulation issues.\nHemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):\nValue: 34 mmol/mol\nThis is a measure of average blood sugar over the past 2\u20133 months and is within the normal range.\n5. Summary:\nNormal Results: Most values fall within the normal range, indicating good overall health.\nMild Concern: The elevated potassium level (4.7 mmol/L) is slightly above the upper normal limit. This should be monitored, as persistent hyperkalemia may need further investigation.\nIf you have further questions about specific values or their implications, you may want to discuss them with a healthcare professional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nTell me in non laymen terms\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere\u2019s a more detailed clinical interpretation of the results:\n\n1. Hematology:\nLeukocytes (Leukocytter; B):\n5.7 \u00d7 10\u2079/L is within the reference interval for white blood cells. This indicates no leukocytosis (elevated WBC, often due to infection, inflammation, or hematologic disorders) or leukopenia (low WBC, which could indicate immunosuppression or bone marrow dysfunction).\nThrombocytes (Trombocytter; B):\n169 \u00d7 10\u2079/L is a normal platelet count, falling well within the standard range of 150\u2013400 \u00d7 10\u2079/L. This shows adequate thrombopoiesis and no evidence of thrombocytopenia (low platelets, associated with bleeding risk) or thrombocytosis (high platelets, which can suggest inflammation or a myeloproliferative disorder).\n2. Fluid and Electrolyte Balance:\neGFR (CKD-EPI calculation):\nThe value >90 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 indicates optimal kidney filtration capacity, placing the patient in stage 1 of the CKD classification, with no evidence of chronic kidney disease. This demonstrates preserved nephron function and no significant reduction in glomerular filtration.\nPotassium (Kalium; P):\n4.7 mmol/L is marginally elevated (normal range ~3.5\u20134.5 mmol/L). This mild hyperkalemia could be due to transient factors (e.g., hemolysis during sample collection, high dietary intake) or early signs of reduced renal potassium excretion. Persistent elevation might require further workup to rule out conditions such as hypoaldosteronism, acidosis, or potassium-retaining medications.\nCreatinine (Kreatinin; P):\n80 \u00b5mol/L falls within the normal range, indicating no elevation in serum creatinine and, by extension, no significant decline in renal filtration capacity. This is consistent with the eGFR result.\n3. Organ Markers:\nSodium (Natrium; P):\n142 mmol/L is physiologically normal, reflecting normal osmoregulation and sodium balance. There\u2019s no evidence of hypernatremia or hyponatremia, which could indicate issues like dehydration, renal salt-wasting, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).\nAlanine Transaminase (ALAT; P):\n24 U/L is well within normal limits. This transaminase, a hepatocyte marker, does not suggest hepatocellular injury or increased liver turnover (seen in viral hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.).\nAlkaline Phosphatase (Basisk fosfatase; P):\n44 U/L is also normal and suggests no cholestatic liver disease, biliary obstruction, or increased bone turnover.\n4. Metabolic Markers:\nGlucose (derived from HbA1c):\n5.8 mmol/L is within normal glycemic control parameters. This reflects stable blood glucose regulation and rules out fasting hyperglycemia or pre-diabetes ranges.\nHemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):\n34 mmol/mol corresponds to an average blood glucose of ~5.8 mmol/L over 2\u20133 months. This result is well below the diagnostic thresholds for diabetes (>48 mmol/mol) or prediabetes (39\u201348 mmol/mol), indicating normal glucose metabolism.\n5. Overall Analysis:\nClinical Stability: Most biomarkers are within physiological ranges, suggesting no acute or chronic pathology.\nMild Anomaly: The slightly elevated potassium warrants mild clinical vigilance to assess for any consistent trends or underlying etiologies, particularly related to renal potassium handling or possible sample hemolysis.\nNo Immediate Red Flags: All other parameters are reassuring, with normal liver and kidney function, electrolyte balance, and metabolic control.\nFurther action might include rechecking potassium levels under fasting conditions and correlating clinically with any potential contributing factors (e.g., diet, medications, comorbidities).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nNow in laymen terms\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere\u2019s a simpler explanation:\n\n1. Blood Counts:\nWhite Blood Cells (Leukocytes): The count is normal, meaning your immune system is functioning properly and there's no sign of infection or inflammation.\nPlatelets (Thrombocytes): These are also in the normal range, showing that your blood can clot well when needed.\n2. Kidney Function and Electrolytes:\nKidney Function (eGFR): Your kidneys are working perfectly, filtering waste and fluids efficiently.\nPotassium: This is a little higher than normal. It\u2019s not a big concern right now but might need to be checked again. Potassium levels can go up because of diet, medications, or minor issues with how your body processes it.\nCreatinine: This is a normal kidney marker, confirming that your kidneys are healthy.\n3. Liver and Bone Health:\nLiver Enzymes (ALAT and Alkaline Phosphatase): Both are normal, meaning there\u2019s no sign of liver damage or bile flow issues. Your bones also seem healthy based on these markers.\n4. Blood Sugar:\nGlucose (from HbA1c): Your blood sugar levels over the past few months have been stable and in the healthy range.\nHbA1c: This confirms no signs of diabetes or prediabetes. Your sugar control is excellent.\n5. Summary:\nOverall, everything looks good! The only thing that stands out is the slightly high potassium, which is likely a minor issue and may not mean anything serious. It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on, though. Otherwise, your results show a healthy liver, kidneys, blood sugar, and no signs of major problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nIs it better than average?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, your results are generally better than average for most parameters. Here's why:\n\nWhat Stands Out as Better Than Average:\nKidney Function (eGFR):\n\nA value of >90 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 is excellent and indicates that your kidneys are functioning optimally. This is better than many people of the same age, as kidney function naturally declines with age or due to lifestyle factors.\nBlood Sugar (HbA1c):\n\nYour HbA1c of 34 mmol/mol shows great glucose control, which is better than average for the general population. Many people start seeing higher values with age or due to diet/lifestyle.\nLiver Health:\n\nBoth liver enzyme markers (ALAT and alkaline phosphatase) are within the healthy, low range, which reflects excellent liver function. Many people have elevated markers due to lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption or fatty liver.\nWhat Is Neutral or Needs Monitoring:\nPotassium (4.7 mmol/L): While slightly elevated, it's not uncommon and could be related to transient factors like diet or lab variability. It\u2019s not concerning unless it remains consistently high.\nConclusion:\nYes, your results indicate a healthier-than-average status in terms of kidney function, blood sugar regulation, and liver health. Apart from the slightly elevated potassium (which may not mean much), your results suggest a well-maintained overall health profile. Keep up any good habits like balanced nutrition, regular activity, and hydration, as they likely contribute to these positive results!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat can I do to improve it further \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTo improve your already good results further and maintain long-term health, you can focus on fine-tuning key areas of your lifestyle. Here\u2019s a breakdown of actionable steps for each category:\n\n1. Manage Potassium Levels\nWhy: Your potassium is slightly elevated, so monitoring it helps maintain proper heart and muscle function.\nActions:\nDietary Adjustments: Reduce high-potassium foods like bananas, oranges, potatoes, and spinach if potassium remains elevated.\nHydration: Stay well-hydrated to help your kidneys excrete excess potassium efficiently.\nMonitor Medications: If you're on medications like ACE inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics, consult your doctor about possible adjustments.\n2. Kidney Health\nWhy: Your kidney function is excellent, and maintaining it protects against long-term decline.\nActions:\nStay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water daily to keep your kidneys flushing waste effectively.\nLimit Salt Intake: Excessive sodium can stress your kidneys. Aim for less than 5g of salt (2g sodium) daily.\nModerate Protein: Avoid very high-protein diets that can strain the kidneys over time.\n3. Blood Sugar Control\nWhy: Your glucose and HbA1c are excellent, and keeping them steady reduces the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular issues.\nActions:\nOptimize Diet: Stick to a balanced diet rich in:\nWhole grains (e.g., quinoa, oats)\nHealthy fats (e.g., olive oil, avocados)\nLean protein (e.g., chicken, fish, tofu)\nVegetables and low-glycemic fruits (e.g., berries).\nExercise Regularly: Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation.\nAvoid Sugary Snacks: Minimize processed sugars to prevent blood sugar spikes.\n4. Liver Health\nWhy: Your liver enzymes are normal, and a healthy liver supports digestion, metabolism, and detoxification.\nActions:\nLimit Alcohol: Minimize alcohol consumption to reduce liver strain.\nEat Liver-Friendly Foods:\nLeafy greens (e.g., kale, spinach)\nCruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower)\nAntioxidant-rich foods (e.g., green tea, blueberries).\nExercise: Regular exercise reduces fat buildup in the liver.\n5. General Cardiovascular Health\nWhy: Maintaining strong cardiovascular health supports overall longevity.\nActions:\nRegular Exercise: Aim for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (e.g., walking, cycling) weekly plus strength training twice a week.\nHealthy Fats: Include omega-3 fatty acids from fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel) or supplements to reduce inflammation and improve heart health.\nManage Stress: Practice mindfulness, yoga, or meditation to lower cortisol, which can impact blood pressure and heart health.\n6. Regular Monitoring\nWhy: Tracking your results ensures small issues are caught early.\nActions:\nGet regular blood tests to monitor potassium and other markers.\nUse wearable health devices (e.g., Apple Watch) to track fitness, hydration, and sleep.\n7. Sleep and Recovery\nWhy: Quality sleep supports optimal metabolic and organ function.\nActions:\nAim for 7-9 hours of sleep nightly.\nMaintain a consistent sleep schedule.\nAvoid caffeine or screens late in the evening.\n8. Supplements (Optional)\nWhy: Supplements can complement a healthy lifestyle.\nConsider:\nMagnesium: To balance potassium levels and support muscle/nerve function.\nVitamin D: If levels are low, it helps immune function and bone health.\nProbiotics: Improve gut health, which can impact overall metabolism and inflammation.\nKey Areas to Track\nPotassium levels (recheck after diet adjustments or consultation).\nBlood pressure (to ensure it stays optimal).\nLong-term trends in HbA1c, kidney function, and liver enzymes.\nBy maintaining these habits, you\u2019ll not only keep your results optimal but also build resilience against long-term health risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\n\nHere are some more data\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour body tracker data provides valuable insight into your physical composition and metabolism.

However, BMI alone doesn\u2019t account for muscle mass, so it\u2019s not always a perfect measure.\nBody Fat Percentage (Fedtprocent): 19%\nThis is considered healthy for men, with the average range being 18\u201324%. For further optimization, aiming for 15\u201318% could be ideal if you're pursuing peak fitness.\nMuscle Mass (Muskelmasse): 40.9 kg\nA strong metric, indicating a good amount of lean body tissue.\nFat Mass (Fedtmasse): 16.7 kg\nThis is consistent with your body fat percentage and indicates a good balance of fat and muscle.\nBody Water Percentage (Kropsvand): 59.3%\nThis is within the healthy range (50\u201365%), reflecting good hydration and cellular health.\nFat-Free Mass (Fedtfri Masse): 71 kg\nRepresents the total weight of bones, muscles, water, and other lean tissues.\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio (Talje-hofte-forhold): 0.96\nThis is slightly on the higher side, as optimal values for men are typically below 0.90. A lower ratio reduces the risk of metabolic diseases.\nBasal Metabolic Rate (Hvilestofskifte): 1904 kcal\nIndicates the number of calories your body burns at rest, a useful baseline for planning nutrition and energy expenditure.\n2. Overall Assessment:\nStrengths:\n\nYour muscle mass is strong, and your fat percentage is below average for your BMI category.\nHydration levels (body water percentage) are healthy.\nYour basal metabolic rate is efficient for your weight and composition.\nAreas to Improve:\n\nBMI and Waist-to-Hip Ratio: These suggest some fat distribution around the midsection, which could increase long-term risks for metabolic or cardiovascular conditions.\nBody Fat Percentage: While healthy, reducing it slightly to 15\u201318% could enhance performance and lower risks.\n3. Recommendations for Improvement:\nA. Nutrition:\nCaloric Intake:\nTo lose fat while maintaining muscle, aim for a calorie deficit of ~500 kcal/day. This means consuming around 1400\u20131600 kcal/day from food, depending on your activity level.\nMacronutrient Balance:\nProtein: 1.6\u20132.2g per kg of body weight (140\u2013190g/day) to support muscle retention.\nCarbohydrates: Moderate intake from whole grains, vegetables, and fruits (40\u201350% of total calories).\nFats: Focus on healthy fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil) but limit saturated fats to around 20\u201330% of calories.\nB. Exercise:\nStrength Training:\nFocus on resistance training 3\u20134 times/week to maintain or increase muscle mass. Include compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses.\nCardio:\nIncorporate moderate-intensity cardio 2\u20133 times/week for 20\u201330 minutes to target fat reduction.\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):\nA great method to improve waist-to-hip ratio and burn calories efficiently. Add 1\u20132 sessions per week.\nC. Lifestyle:\nHydration:\nContinue to maintain good hydration by drinking 2.5\u20133 liters of water daily, especially during physical activity.\nSleep:\nAim for 7\u20139 hours of quality sleep to optimize recovery, metabolism, and stress management.\nStress Management:\nPractice mindfulness or relaxation techniques to reduce cortisol levels, which can affect fat distribution.\nD. Waist-to-Hip Ratio:\nInclude core-focused exercises like planks, side planks, and hanging leg raises to tighten abdominal muscles.\nMonitor waist measurements monthly as an indicator of progress.\n4. Summary of Goals:\nShort-Term (1\u20133 months): Focus on reducing fat percentage to 17\u201318% while preserving or slightly increasing muscle mass.\nLong-Term (6\u201312 months): Improve your waist-to-hip ratio to below 0.90 by targeting abdominal fat and maintaining overall strength.\nOverall Aim: Achieve optimal health metrics, balance body composition, and enhance physical performance.\nWith these targeted improvements, you\u2019ll move from a healthy baseline to peak fitness!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYou are now an expert in nutrition and fitness and a medical professional\n Take a look at the data and revise \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nRevised Analysis and Recommendations Based on Your Body and Lab Data\nI\u2019ve reviewed your body composition and biochemical markers as both a nutrition and fitness expert and a medical professional, and here\u2019s a deeper, tailored plan to optimize your health and physical performance while addressing potential risks.\n\n1. Key Observations from Lab Data and Body Composition:\nStrengths:\nBlood Sugar Control: Your HbA1c and glucose levels show excellent blood sugar regulation, better than most, indicating no metabolic concerns like prediabetes or diabetes.\nKidney Function: eGFR and creatinine are optimal, reflecting great kidney health and fluid balance.\nLiver Function: Normal ALT and alkaline phosphatase levels show no liver stress or damage.\nBody Fat Percentage: At 19%, you are in the lean category for men, particularly at your age, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\nMuscle Mass: 40.9 kg is a strong foundation and reflects a healthy lean body mass. This is an excellent platform for further strength and metabolic efficiency.\nAreas to Address:\nPotassium Levels (4.7 mmol/L):\nSlightly elevated potassium may be due to diet (potassium-rich foods like bananas, avocados, spinach), dehydration, or sampling issues (e.g., hemolysis). Chronic elevation warrants monitoring.\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio (0.96):\nSlightly above the ideal range for men (<0.90). Higher ratios are linked to visceral fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.\nBMI (26.5):\nWhile this indicates \"overweight,\" your high muscle mass makes BMI less relevant. Focus on fat percentage and waist measurements instead.\nBasal Metabolic Rate (BMR at 1904 kcal):\nWith this baseline, you need to ensure energy intake and expenditure align with your goals (e.g., fat loss, muscle gain, or maintenance).\n2. Action Plan to Optimize Health and Fitness\nA. Nutritional Strategy\nCalorie Target:\n\nFat Loss (if desired): Aim for ~1900\u20132200 kcal/day (mild deficit). This will allow gradual fat loss (~0.5 kg/week) without muscle loss.\nMaintenance: ~2400\u20132600 kcal/day, depending on activity levels.\nMacronutrient Breakdown:\n\nProtein: 1.8\u20132.2g/kg (160\u2013190g daily). Supports muscle retention and repair. Prioritize lean sources like chicken, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, or plant-based proteins.\nFats: ~20\u201325% of total calories (~50\u201370g/day). Focus on healthy fats from nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil, and fatty fish.\nCarbohydrates: The remainder (~45\u201350% of total calories). Prioritize complex carbs like oats, quinoa, sweet potatoes, and vegetables.\nPotassium Management:\n\nMonitor intake of potassium-rich foods (e.g., bananas, tomatoes, spinach, avocados). Pair potassium-rich meals with plenty of fluids and sodium to balance electrolyte levels.\nHydration: Aim for 3 liters of water daily, especially if exercising intensely or sweating heavily.\nSupplements (Optional):\n\nOmega-3s: 2\u20133g/day for heart health and inflammation reduction.\nMagnesium (200\u2013400mg/day): Helps with potassium balance, muscle recovery, and sleep quality.\nVitamin D (1000\u20132000 IU/day): Supports muscle, immune function, and overall energy levels.\nB. Exercise Recommendations\nResistance Training:\n\nFocus on 4\u20135 sessions/week targeting all major muscle groups. Incorporate:\nCompound lifts (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench press) to maintain/increase muscle mass.\nAccessory work (e.g., lunges, rows) for core strength and balance.\nAim for progressive overload to build muscle while maintaining a lean body fat percentage.\nCardiovascular Exercise:\n\nInclude 2\u20133 sessions/week of moderate-intensity cardio (cycling, jogging, swimming) for heart health and to improve waist-to-hip ratio.\nAdd HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) 1\u20132 times per week for visceral fat reduction and calorie burn.\nCore-Focused Workouts:\n\nPlanks, side planks, and ab wheel rollouts to improve waist definition and reduce visceral fat.\nStretching and Mobility:\n\nDedicate 10\u201315 minutes/day to stretching and mobility work to reduce injury risk and improve overall performance.\nC. Lifestyle Adjustments\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio Improvement:\n\nTarget a reduction of visceral fat through consistent caloric deficits, cardio, and stress management (visceral fat responds well to cortisol reduction).\nMonitor progress with waist circumference (monthly measurements).\nStress and Recovery:\n\nPractice mindfulness or yoga to lower cortisol levels, which contribute to visceral fat storage.\nPrioritize 7\u20139 hours of quality sleep per night to optimize recovery and fat metabolism.\nMonitor and Reassess:\n\nRecheck potassium levels in 4\u20136 weeks. If levels remain elevated, consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying issues.\nTrack body fat percentage and waist-to-hip ratio monthly to assess progress.\n3. Long-Term Goals\nFat Percentage: Lower to 15\u201317% for enhanced fitness and reduced risk of metabolic conditions.\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio: Reduce below 0.90 through targeted visceral fat reduction.\nStrength and Muscle Mass: Maintain or increase lean muscle mass while improving functional fitness.\n4. Summary\nYou\u2019re starting from an excellent baseline of health and fitness, with only mild areas for optimization. By refining your diet, increasing focus on resistance and core training, and keeping an eye on potassium and waist measurements, you can move from \"above average\" health to peak physical condition while reducing any long-term health risks. Regular monitoring and small, consistent adjustments will be key!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\n\nShow me where is lie in comparison with average \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTo compare your body metrics with averages, here\u2019s where you stand:\n\n1.

Let me know how it feels after a couple of weeks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nGreat more advice ?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere\u2019s some additional advice to help you optimize your workouts, fat loss, and muscle maintenance while keeping things simple and effective:\n\n1. Optimize Recovery\nRecovery is as important as your workout. Without it, progress slows, and you risk fatigue or injury.\n\nSleep: Aim for 7\u20139 hours of quality sleep each night. Growth hormone, essential for muscle repair and fat loss, is released during deep sleep.\nStretching: After each workout, stretch the major muscle groups you worked to improve flexibility and reduce soreness. Focus on quads, hamstrings, shoulders, and chest.\nActive Rest Days: On non-workout days, engage in light activities like walking, cycling, or yoga. This keeps you active without overloading your muscles.\n2. Nutrition Tweaks for Fat Loss and Muscle Maintenance\nHigh Protein Intake: Aim for 1.6\u20132.2g of protein per kg of body weight (~140\u2013190g for you). This preserves muscle during fat loss. Examples:\nChicken, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, tofu, and protein shakes.\nBalanced Meals: Include protein, healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil), and complex carbs (quinoa, oats, sweet potatoes) in every meal.\nCalorie Deficit: Create a modest deficit of 500 kcal/day for fat loss (~1900\u20132100 kcal/day for you). This ensures gradual, sustainable weight loss.\nTrack Progress: Use a food tracking app (e.g., MyFitnessPal) to monitor your intake. Adjust calories if weight loss stalls for 2+ weeks.\n3. Monitor and Adjust for Progress\nStrength Progress: Gradually increase weights or reps every 2\u20133 weeks to ensure your muscles are challenged.\nBody Composition: Reassess fat percentage, waist measurements, or photos every 4 weeks rather than relying solely on weight.\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio: Track waist circumference to ensure fat is reducing in the midsection over time.\n4. Add Variety (if Needed)\nWhile identical days are great for simplicity, after 6\u20138 weeks, your body may adapt. Consider rotating in a few new exercises to keep progress steady:\n\nSwap leg extensions for walking lunges or step-ups.\nReplace push-ups with incline push-ups or bench presses.\nAlternate EZ Bar triceps extensions with dips (bodyweight or weighted).\n5. Incorporate Low-Intensity Cardio\nAdd a 30\u201345 minute walk or easy bike ride 1\u20132 times per week. Low-intensity cardio is a great fat-burning tool that doesn\u2019t interfere with muscle recovery.\n6. Focus on Core Strength\nA strong core not only improves performance but also helps reduce waist-to-hip ratio. Add simple core exercises to your routine (2\u20133 times per week):\n\nHanging Leg Raises: 3 sets of 10\u201312 reps.\nSide Plank Holds: Hold for 20\u201330 seconds per side.\nCable Woodchoppers (if available): 3 sets of 12 per side.\n7. Hydration and Supplements\nStay Hydrated: Drink 2.5\u20133 liters/day. Proper hydration supports fat metabolism and performance.\nOptional Supplements:\nWhey Protein: To meet protein goals easily.\nCreatine Monohydrate: 5g daily for strength and endurance.\nOmega-3s: For inflammation and recovery.\nVitamin D: If you\u2019re not exposed to much sunlight (~1000\u20132000 IU/day).\n8. Stick with a Routine\nKeep your workouts scheduled on consistent days each week (e.g., Monday and Thursday).\nCreate a pre-workout routine to get into the right mindset (e.g., listen to music, light stretching).\n9. Patience and Consistency\nFat loss and muscle maintenance are long-term goals. Focus on small wins:\n\nLifting slightly heavier weights.\nSeeing your waist measurements shrink.\nFeeling stronger and more energized over time.\nLet me know if you\u2019d like help fine-tuning any of these points or creating a progress tracker to keep you on track!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\n\n\n\nWorkout today \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour workout today looks excellent based on the data provided.

Heart Rate Training Zones\nMaximum (Zone 5): 8 minutes (12%)\nShort, intense bursts likely during high-effort lifts or intervals. Great for stimulating fat loss and anaerobic capacity.\nHard (Zone 4): 29 minutes (41%)\nExcellent for improving cardiovascular fitness and burning calories. Spending this much time in Zone 4 is ideal for your goals.\nModerate (Zone 3): 20 minutes (29%)\nEfficient for building aerobic capacity and burning fat.\nLight (Zone 2): 12 minutes (17%)\nRecovery and maintaining heart rate between efforts.\nVery Light (Zone 1): Minimal time (<1%), which is expected during an intense workout.\n4. Heart Rate Recovery\nDrop in 2 Minutes: 49 bpm (from 165 bpm to 116 bpm)\nRating: Good, bordering on excellent.\nThis reflects solid cardiovascular fitness. Aim to improve this further by including more cardio-focused sessions (e.g., moderate-intensity runs or intervals).\n5. VO2 Max (Cardio Fitness)\nVO2 Max: 49.7\nCategory: Excellent\nThis places you in the top fitness range for your age and gender, showcasing impressive aerobic capacity.\nRecommendations to Enhance Progress\nMaintain High-Intensity Efforts:\n\nSpending 40\u201350% of your workout in Zone 4 is ideal for both fat loss and cardiovascular improvements. Continue incorporating these high-effort bursts (e.g., heavy lifts, short sprints).\nIncrease Recovery Rate:\n\nTo improve your heart rate recovery, include a mix of moderate aerobic activities (e.g., cycling, jogging) on rest days. Recovery rate correlates with overall heart health and endurance.\nSupplement with Steady-State Cardio (Optional):\n\nAdd a 20\u201330 minute Zone 2 (Light) cardio session once a week to improve overall aerobic efficiency without overloading your system.\nFocus on Progressive Overload:\n\nGradually increase weights, reps, or reduce rest time between sets to challenge your muscles and avoid plateaus. Track your lifts weekly to ensure progress.\nStrengthen Anaerobic Capacity:\n\nInclude more short, explosive movements like jump squats, kettlebell swings, or sprints to increase time in the anaerobic zone (Zone 5).\nNutrition Advice for Recovery\nPost-Workout Meal:\nHigh-protein (30\u201340g) + carbs (40\u201350g) within 1\u20132 hours after training.\nExample: Grilled chicken with sweet potato and steamed veggies, or a protein shake with a banana.\nStay Hydrated:\nAim for 2.5\u20133 liters of water per day, especially after a high-intensity workout like today.\nSummary\nToday's workout was highly effective for both fat loss and fitness improvement. Your balance of strength training and cardio intensity is ideal for maintaining muscle while burning fat. Keep up the consistency, and you\u2019ll continue to see great results!

This could be due to consistent physical activity and/or dietary adjustments.\nHealth Risks of Overweight BMI:\n\nA BMI in the overweight range may be associated with increased risks of:\nCardiovascular disease\nHypertension\nType 2 diabetes\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t account for muscle mass or body composition (e.g., fat percentage), which is crucial for accurate health interpretation.\nComplementary Metrics:\n\nIf available, pairing BMI with metrics like fat percentage and muscle mass can give a clearer picture of your health. For example, a higher BMI with a low-fat percentage (and high muscle mass) may still indicate good health.\nRecommendations to Improve BMI\nPhysical Activity:\n\nMaintain your current functional strength training and cardiovascular workouts (e.g., racquetball), as they seem effective in reducing BMI.\nInclude high-intensity interval training (HIIT) twice a week to boost metabolism and improve fat loss.\nNutrition Adjustments:\n\nFocus on a calorie deficit diet while ensuring adequate protein intake to preserve muscle mass.\nPrioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods and reduce refined sugar or empty-calorie intake.\nTrack Body Composition:\n\nMonitor fat percentage and muscle mass alongside BMI to ensure weight changes come primarily from fat loss rather than muscle.\nHealth Checkup:\n\nIf unsure, consult with a healthcare provider or nutritionist for a deeper assessment of metabolic health and tailored recommendations.\nNext Steps\nWould you like me to analyze this trend further or correlate it with other metrics like fat percentage, muscle mass, or physical activity? Alternatively, I can help build a longer-term plan based on your specific health goals.

Identify Key Trends\nGoal: Understand how your health metrics (e.g., BMI, heart rate, and other observations) have changed over time.\nAction:\nPlot trends for observations like BMI, body fat percentage, and resting heart rate.\nUse time-series analysis to detect patterns or seasonal variations in metrics.\n2. Correlation Analysis\nGoal: Explore relationships between metrics like physical activity levels, calorie burn, and health markers.\nAction:\nAnalyze correlations between BMI and activity levels (e.g., number of steps or workout calories burned).\nExamine if increased activity or workouts correlates with improved metrics like lower resting heart rate or BMI.\n3. Anomaly Detection\nGoal: Identify any unusual changes or outliers in health data, which might warrant closer attention.\nAction:\nFlag outliers in BMI, heart rate, or other key metrics.\nInvestigate potential causes (e.g., changes in routine, diet, or workouts).\n4. Drill Down by Activity Type\nGoal: Analyze how different workout types (e.g., strength training, racquetball) impact health metrics like calorie burn, heart rate zones, and recovery.\nAction:\nCompare average heart rate, calorie burn, and effort for different activity types.\nUse this to optimize workout routines for specific goals like fat loss or endurance improvement.\n5.

This is likely based on physiological data such as heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate, or other metrics associated with stress detection.\nBreakdown of Stress Levels:\n\nLow Stress: 97% of the time (5 hours and 30 minutes), you experienced a low level of stress.\nModerate Stress: For 5 minutes (1%), you experienced moderate stress.\nElevated Stress: There were no periods of elevated stress (0%).\nHigh Stress: You experienced 5 minutes (1%) of high stress.\nGraph Analysis:\n\nThe blue bars represent low stress, which dominates most of the graph, indicating a calm state.\nThe green bar indicates a period of moderate stress.\nThe red bar represents a short period of high stress, possibly a spike due to a specific event or activity.\nInsights:\n\nYour overall stress management seems excellent, as most of your time is spent in a low-stress state.\nThe short high-stress periods may be worth noting to identify triggers and evaluate whether they require attention.\nRecommendations:\n\nMaintain your current stress management strategies, as they are working well.\nIf you'd like to reduce the high-stress moments further, consider techniques like mindfulness, deep breathing, or identifying potential stress triggers.\nTrack patterns over multiple days to see if certain times or activities consistently lead to stress spikes.\nWould you like a deeper analysis or tips to reduce stress further?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\nBut why is it 77 at 7am?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThe stress level spike to 77 at 7:00 AM could be due to several factors, depending on how the device calculates stress:\n\nWake-Up Response:\n\nWhen you wake up, your body experiences a natural increase in cortisol levels (the stress hormone) as part of the circadian rhythm. This is a normal biological response to prepare your body for the day.\nPhysical Activity or Movement:\n\nIf you moved quickly, exercised, or performed any strenuous activity right after waking up, this could elevate your heart rate, which the device might interpret as a sign of stress.\nSleep Transition:\n\nIf your sleep was interrupted or you transitioned from deep sleep to wakefulness abruptly, it could cause a temporary increase in physiological stress markers.\nMeasurement Sensitivity:\n\nThe algorithm may have interpreted heart rate variability (HRV) changes or an elevated heart rate as a stress spike. HRV tends to be lower in the early morning hours, which can influence stress calculations.\nExternal Factors:\n\nNoise, light, or a sudden environmental change (like an alarm) could trigger a temporary stress spike.\nRecommendations:\nReflect on your morning habits: Did anything unusual happen at 7:00 AM?\nCheck trends: Does this spike happen every morning, or was this unique? Repeated spikes may suggest an opportunity to adjust your morning routine.\nMonitor future patterns: Use mindfulness or relaxation techniques in the morning if this stress spike becomes consistent.\nWould you like insights on reducing morning stress spikes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour current body composition analysis highlights several key metrics:\n\nBody Metrics Breakdown:\nWeight (Kropsv\u00e6gt):\n\n87.8 kg\nThis indicates total body weight, combining muscle, fat, bone, and water.\nBody Fat Percentage (Fedtprocent):\n\n18.1%\nThis is within a fit range for men (12\u201318%). It's a strong indicator of good physical health but can be fine-tuned based on goals.\nMuscle Mass (Muskelmasse):\n\n41.5 kg\nThis reflects the weight of your muscles. For your weight, this is a good balance. Maintaining or increasing muscle mass during fat loss is crucial.\nFat Mass (Fedtmasse):\n\n15.9 kg\nThis is derived from your total weight and body fat percentage. Reducing fat mass further depends on dietary consistency and exercise intensity.\nBody Water (Kropsvand):\n\n60%\nThis is normal for a healthy male. Staying hydrated impacts performance and overall health.\nLean Mass (Fedtfri Masse):\n\n71.9 kg\nThis consists of muscle, bone, and water. It represents the \"functional\" weight that supports performance and metabolism.\nWaist-Hip Ratio (Talje-hofte-forhold):\n\n0.94\nThis is slightly high. Aim for a ratio below 0.90, as higher values can indicate central fat, linked to greater health risks.\nBasal Metabolic Rate (Hvileforbr\u00e6nding):\n\n1923 kcal/day\nThis is the energy your body needs to maintain vital functions at rest. Total caloric needs increase with activity.\nRecommendations:\nFat Loss Goals:\n\nAim for gradual fat loss (~0.5 kg/week) by maintaining a caloric deficit of 500\u2013750 kcal/day. Adjust as needed based on performance and recovery.\nMuscle Maintenance:\n\nContinue resistance training to preserve lean mass. Focus on compound movements (e.g., squats, deadlifts, presses).\nCardio & Stress Management:\n\nIncorporate 2\u20133 sessions of cardio weekly for heart health and fat loss. Monitor stress, as it can impact weight loss and muscle recovery.\nDiet:\n\nProtein: ~1.6\u20132.2 g/kg of body weight (~140\u2013180 g/day).\nFats: 20\u201330% of daily caloric intake.\nCarbohydrates: Adjust as per activity levels.\nWould you like a specific workout or nutrition plan tailored to this data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nHow do I work on my lats?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTo effectively work on your lats (latissimus dorsi) and build a stronger, broader back, focus on the following exercises and principles:\n\nKey Exercises for Lats:\n1. Pull-Ups/Chin-Ups (Bodyweight)\nMuscles Worked: Lats, biceps, and upper back.\nHow-To:\nGrip a pull-up bar with an overhand (pull-up) or underhand (chin-up) grip.\nPull yourself up until your chin is above the bar.\nLower yourself in a controlled motion.\nProgression: Add weight with a dip belt or resistance bands if needed.\n2. Lat Pulldowns (Machine)\nMuscles Worked: Lats, shoulders, and biceps.\nHow-To:\nSit on a lat pulldown machine and grip the bar wider than shoulder-width.\nPull the bar down to your chest while keeping your torso upright.\nSlowly return to the starting position.\n3. Barbell or Dumbbell Rows\nMuscles Worked: Lats, traps, and rhomboids.\nHow-To:\nBend at the hips with your back straight.\nPull the barbell or dumbbell toward your lower ribcage.\nLower the weight in a controlled motion.\nTip: Keep your elbows close to your body to target the lats more effectively.\n4. One-Arm Dumbbell Rows\nMuscles Worked: Lats and stabilizing muscles.\nHow-To:\nRest one knee and hand on a bench.\nPull the dumbbell toward your waist.\nLower it slowly, focusing on the stretch in your lat.\n5. Deadlifts\nMuscles Worked: Lats (as stabilizers), lower back, glutes, and hamstrings.\nHow-To:\nUse proper form with a neutral spine.\nEngage your lats by squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.\n6. Straight-Arm Pulldowns (Cable)\nMuscles Worked: Lats and core.\nHow-To:\nAttach a straight bar to a high pulley.\nWith straight arms, pull the bar down to your thighs.\nSlowly return to the starting position.\n7. T-Bar Rows\nMuscles Worked: Lats, traps, and rear delts.\nHow-To:\nPlace a barbell in a T-bar row attachment.\nGrip the handle, bend at the hips, and row the bar toward your chest.\nTips for Maximum Lat Engagement:\nFull Range of Motion: Fully stretch your lats at the bottom of each rep and squeeze them at the top.\nMind-Muscle Connection: Focus on contracting your lats during pulling movements instead of just moving the weight.\nElbow Positioning: Keep your elbows close to your torso during rows and pulldowns to better isolate the lats.\nGrip Width: Use a slightly wider grip for pull-ups and pulldowns to emphasize the outer lats for a \"V-taper\" look.\nProgressive Overload: Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets to continuously challenge your muscles.\nSample Lat-Focused Workout:\nPull-Ups or Lat Pulldowns: 4 sets of 8\u201312 reps.\nOne-Arm Dumbbell Rows: 4 sets of 10\u201312 reps per side.\nStraight-Arm Pulldowns: 3 sets of 12\u201315 reps.\nT-Bar Rows: 3 sets of 8\u201310 reps.\nDeadlifts (Optional): 3 sets of 6\u20138 reps.\nWould you like help tracking progress or incorporating these into your existing program?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nAdd all relevant data in this conversation to memory\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nI've added the details from this conversation to memory.

How would you like me to proceed? Should I interpret these images, extract specific insights, or consolidate the data into an analysis? Let me know!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nUse your prompt\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nLet\u2019s use the images and analyze the provided health data using the fitness-related prompts we developed earlier. I\u2019ll consolidate information across metrics such as body composition, cardio fitness, heart rate, and workout performance. Here\u2019s the step-by-step plan:\n\nHeart Rate Recovery & Zones: Analyze recovery rates, time spent in training zones, and their implications on aerobic and anaerobic fitness.\nBody Composition: Assess metrics like body fat percentage, muscle mass, and water percentage to provide insights on fitness progress and goals.\nWorkout Intensity and Effort: Evaluate effort scores, TRIMP, and VO2Max trends to understand training adaptation and progress.\nCardio Fitness (VO2Max): Use VO2Max and other indicators to determine cardiovascular endurance and improvement opportunities.\nStep 1: Heart Rate Recovery & Zones\nHeart Rate Recovery (HRR): Your recovery from 180 bpm to 137 bpm within 2 minutes indicates an excellent fitness level, showcasing strong cardiovascular health.\nTime in Zones: Spending 46% in Hard (Zone 4) and 26% in Moderate (Zone 3) suggests optimal cardiovascular strain, improving both endurance and strength. Minimal time in Very Light zones (<1%) shows efficient workout intensity.\nStep 2: Body Composition Insights\nBody Fat Percentage: At 18.1%, your fat percentage aligns with fitness-focused goals for men, indicating a lean body composition.\nMuscle Mass: With 41.5 kg of muscle, you\u2019re maintaining a strong physique. Coupled with the high water percentage (60%), this suggests good hydration and healthy muscle tissue.\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio: A ratio of 0.94 is on the threshold of ideal for men; maintaining it will further reduce cardiovascular risks.\nResting Metabolic Rate (RMR): At 1923 kcal, this is your baseline caloric need without activity. Use this as a guide for caloric intake during recovery or fat loss phases.\nStep 3: Workout Intensity and Effort\nEffort (6.01): This workout was slightly below your highest effort (6.49). It still reflects a high level of training stress, improving fatigue resistance.\nTRIMP: A Training Impulse of 146 indicates a balanced mix of high aerobic (46%) and anaerobic (20%) focus, which is excellent for athletic conditioning.\nCalories Burned: Burning 562 calories in a single session suggests an effective combination of resistance and cardio training.\nStep 4: Cardio Fitness\nVO2Max: At 54.3, your VO2Max ranks as \"Excellent\" for your age group, reflecting elite-level cardiovascular fitness. Maintaining or improving this metric will further enhance endurance.\nNext Steps:\nRefinement Goals:\nIncrease muscle mass (e.g., 42-43 kg) to improve strength while maintaining 18% body fat.\nOptimize endurance by alternating between aerobic-dominant and anaerobic-dominant workouts.\nTracking Recommendations:\nLog weekly HRR and VO2Max trends to monitor adaptation.\nTrack macros aligned with your RMR and workout intensity for fat loss or maintenance.\nNew Challenges:\nIncorporate new exercises targeting underworked areas (e.g., lats).\nAdd interval training to improve Zone 4 endurance further.\nLet me know if you\u2019d like deeper insights into any specific metric or tailored fitness advice!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat's my body's age based on these stats\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nBased on the data provided, we can estimate your body age by comparing your fitness stats (e.g., VO2Max, body fat percentage, muscle mass, heart rate recovery, and waist-to-hip ratio) to the averages for your chronological age (36). Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. VO2Max (Cardio Fitness):\nYour VO2Max: 54.3 (excellent).\nFor a 36-year-old man: Average VO2Max is ~41.\nBody Age Based on VO2Max: ~20-25 years.\nThis shows an exceptional cardiovascular system, typical of someone significantly younger.\n2. Body Fat Percentage:\nYour Body Fat: 18.1%.\nHealthy Range for Men:\nAge 20-39: 8-20%.\nAge 40-59: 11-22%.\nBody Age Based on Body Fat: ~30-35 years.\nYour body fat percentage is lean and aligns with a younger demographic.\n3. Muscle Mass:\nYour Muscle Mass: 41.5 kg.\nHealthy Range for Men:\nAge 20-39: 37-42 kg.\nAge 40-59: 36-41 kg.\nBody Age Based on Muscle Mass: ~30 years.\nThis suggests strong muscular development, characteristic of someone in their early 30s.\n4. Heart Rate Recovery (HRR):\nYour HRR: 43 bpm drop in 2 minutes (excellent).\nTypical HRR for Age:\n20-30 years: ~40-50 bpm drop.\n30-40 years: ~30-40 bpm drop.\nBody Age Based on HRR: ~25 years.\nThis reflects efficient cardiovascular recovery akin to a younger individual.\n5. Waist-to-Hip Ratio:\nYour Ratio: 0.94.\nIdeal for Men:\nBelow 0.95 is associated with low cardiovascular risk.\nBody Age Based on Ratio: ~30 years.\nThis places you in the ideal range, reducing health risks.\nEstimated Body Age:\nTaking the average of these metrics, your body age is approximately 28 years, significantly younger than your chronological age of 36.\n\nThis result reflects your excellent cardiovascular health, lean body composition, and strong muscle mass. If you maintain or improve these metrics, you can continue to lower your body age further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat is the most urgent thing to improve to lower my body age further ?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTo further lower your body age, focus on the area with the most room for improvement based on your data:\n\n1. Body Fat Percentage\nCurrent Level: 18.1% (Healthy but can be optimized).\nIdeal for Lowering Body Age: 12-15% for men in their 20s-30s.\nWhy It Matters: Reducing body fat improves overall metabolic health, cardiovascular efficiency, and muscle definition.\nHow to Improve:\nNutrition: Aim for a caloric deficit with high protein intake (~1.6-2.2g per kg of body weight).\nTraining: Add high-intensity interval training (HIIT) 1-2 times a week to burn fat while preserving muscle.\nLifestyle: Optimize sleep (7-9 hours) to regulate hormones like cortisol and insulin that affect fat storage.\n2. Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR)\nCurrent Level: 0.94 (Good but borderline).\nIdeal for Optimal Health: Below 0.9.\nWhy It Matters: WHR is a key indicator of visceral fat, which impacts long-term cardiovascular health.\nHow to Improve:\nCombine strength training (to build muscle in the lower body) with fat reduction strategies.\nFocus on core stability exercises to strengthen and tone the midsection.\n3. Muscle Mass\nCurrent Level: 41.5 kg (Great but could increase for optimal performance).\nWhy It Matters: Higher muscle mass increases resting metabolic rate (RMR), improves functionality, and slows down aging.\nHow to Improve:\nIncrease progressive overload in resistance training, focusing on compound lifts like deadlifts, squats, and pull-ups.\nPrioritize a protein intake of ~2g/kg of body weight.\nRecommendation (Most Urgent):\nFocus on reducing body fat percentage (18.1% \u2192 ~12-15%), as this will have the most immediate impact on lowering your body age. Reducing fat will also naturally improve your waist-to-hip ratio and make muscle definition more prominent, giving you a younger physical profile.\n\nBy tackling body fat percentage first, you'll enhance both appearance and health markers, aligning with metrics typical of someone in their early to mid-20s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\nCritique\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nBased on your physique in the photo and your stated goals:\n\nStrengths:\nGood Muscle Base: Your arms and chest show signs of strength training, indicating a solid foundation to build on.\nProportionate Upper and Lower Body: There\u2019s visible balance between your upper and lower body, which is great for overall aesthetics and functional fitness.\nManageable Body Fat: While there\u2019s fat around the midsection, it\u2019s not excessive, and this is the easiest area to reduce with a targeted approach.\nAreas for Improvement:\nMidsection (Body Fat Reduction):\n\nObservation: The fat stored around the abdominal region is the most noticeable.

Can that work still ?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, fasting in the morning can absolutely work with your fitness and fat loss goals, as long as you adjust your nutrition and workout schedule to fit this routine. Here's how to make it work:\n\nKey Considerations for Fasting:\nTrain During the Fasting Window or After Eating?\n\nIf you prefer to train fasted: Ensure proper hydration and consider having a small pre-workout boost, like black coffee or BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids), to support performance.\nIf you train after breaking your fast, schedule a nutrient-rich meal that includes protein and carbs to fuel your workout and aid recovery.\nFocus on Nutrition Timing Post-Fast:\nAfter breaking your fast, prioritize nutrient-dense meals that align with your workout timing. A balanced post-workout meal will support muscle repair, recovery, and energy replenishment.\n\nFasting Won\u2019t Hurt Fat Loss or Muscle Maintenance:\nAs long as your overall caloric intake and protein consumption remain consistent throughout the day, fasting will not negatively impact your goals.\n\nHow to Adjust the Plan for Morning Fasting:\nTraining Fasted (Morning)\nHydration: Drink water with electrolytes before and during the workout.\nOptional Boost: A cup of black coffee or green tea for energy.\nPost-Workout Meal (Break Fast):\nProtein (chicken, fish, eggs, or a protein shake).\nCarbs (brown rice, oats, or sweet potato).\nFats (avocado, nuts, or olive oil).\nTraining in the Afternoon/Evening (After Breaking Fast)\nFirst Meal (Break Fast):\nProtein (25-30g) + moderate carbs + fats to fuel your day.\nExample: Grilled chicken, quinoa, and a side of avocado.\nPre-Workout Snack (1-2 hours before training):\nA mix of protein and carbs to fuel your session.\nExample: Greek yogurt + a handful of berries or a banana with peanut butter.\nPost-Workout Meal:\nProtein (30-40g) + carbs (to replenish glycogen).\nExample: Lean beef or fish with rice and steamed veggies.\nTips for Fasting & Fat Loss\nProtein is King: Aim for 1.6\u20132.2g of protein per kilogram of body weight daily (split over your eating window).\nStay in a Caloric Deficit: Track calories to ensure you're in a slight deficit (500\u2013750 kcal below maintenance).\nHydration is Key: Fasting can dehydrate you, so prioritize water and electrolytes.\nAvoid Overeating During the Eating Window: Stick to your planned meals, and avoid calorie-dense snacks.\nExample Fasting Schedule\n8 PM - 12 PM: Fasting Window.\n12 PM (Break Fast): High-protein, balanced meal (e.g., eggs, greens, avocado).\n3 PM (Snack): Light snack (protein shake, nuts, or yogurt).\n6 PM (Dinner): Post-workout meal rich in protein and carbs.\n7:30 PM (Optional Snack): Protein + healthy fats.\nBy combining your fasting with the 2-day workout plan, you can maintain fat loss and muscle building. Would you like help tracking your eating or adapting it further to match your fasting schedule?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nHow much hydration \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThe amount of hydration needed depends on your activity level, body weight, and whether you're fasting. Here's a general guideline to ensure proper hydration:\n\nDaily Hydration Recommendations\nBaseline Water Intake:\n\n30\u201335 ml of water per kilogram of body weight.\nExample: If you weigh 88 kg, aim for 2.6\u20133.1 liters per day.\nAdjust for Activity:\n\nAdd 0.5\u20131 liter for every hour of exercise or intense activity.\nThis includes sweat loss during workouts.\nDuring Fasting:\n\nDrink consistently throughout the fasting window to prevent dehydration. Aim for 1 glass of water (250 ml) every 2 hours.\nHydration During Workouts\nDrink 400\u2013600 ml (16\u201320 oz) 30 minutes before exercise.\nSip 150\u2013250 ml (5\u20138 oz) every 15\u201320 minutes during your workout.\nAfter your workout, drink 500\u2013750 ml to rehydrate and replace lost fluids.\nHydration Tips While Fasting\nAdd electrolytes (e.g., a pinch of sea salt or a sugar-free electrolyte mix) to water, especially if you're sweating or feeling fatigued.\nMonitor urine color: Light yellow indicates you're well-hydrated.\nPractical Daily Example for You (Based on 88 kg)\nMorning (during fasting): 500 ml upon waking + 500 ml before noon.\nAfternoon: 1 liter of water spread before and during your workout.\nEvening: 1 liter with meals and snacks, especially after breaking your fast.\nThis brings your total to around 3\u20133.5 liters per day, with adjustments for activity level. Let me know if you'd like help setting reminders for hydration!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat Else to be aware off ?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere are some key factors to be aware of as you balance fasting, workouts, and overall fitness goals with a busy schedule:\n\n1. Nutrition Timing and Quality\nProtein Intake: Make sure to get 1.6\u20132.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (140\u2013190g daily for you). This is essential for muscle maintenance and fat loss.\n\nSpread protein intake across meals to maximize absorption (e.g., 3 meals with 30\u201350g protein).\nFocus on lean sources: eggs, chicken, fish, tofu, lentils, or protein shakes.\nPost-Workout Nutrition:\n\nSince you fast in the morning, ensure you break your fast with a high-protein and nutrient-dense meal within 1\u20132 hours after your workout.\nExample: Grilled chicken, quinoa, and roasted vegetables.\n2. Energy Levels During Workouts\nPre-Workout Fasting:\nIf fasting in the morning works for you, focus on hydration pre-workout. You might also add a low-calorie electrolyte drink to sustain energy and prevent cramps.\nIf you feel fatigued, try breaking your fast earlier with something light, like a small protein shake or 10\u201315g of BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids).\n3. Stress Management\nHigh stress can elevate cortisol levels, which might impact fat loss and sleep.\nAdd mindfulness activities: Deep breathing, yoga, or 5\u201310 minutes of quiet reflection daily.\nBe consistent with good sleep hygiene: Aim for 7\u20139 hours of quality sleep each night.\n4. Recovery\nRest Days Are Crucial: With 2 strength days and 1 cardio day, prioritize active recovery on other days (light walking, stretching, or foam rolling).\nConsider regular mobility exercises to prevent injuries.\n5. Hormonal Health\nFasting can impact hormones if not managed well. Keep an eye on:\nEnergy Levels: If you feel sluggish or fatigued, adjust fasting duration or calorie intake.\nSleep Patterns: Ensure fasting doesn\u2019t disrupt your sleep.\nMood Swings: These may indicate a need for more carbs or fats in your diet.\n6. Cardio (Optional Add-On)\nType of Cardio: Low-intensity steady-state (LISS) is great for fat loss and recovery, while high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can maximize calorie burn in less time.\nStart with 30\u201340 minutes of LISS once per week or a 15-minute HIIT session as a bonus workout.\n7. Body Composition Tracking\nUse metrics like:\nWaist-to-hip ratio: You\u2019re currently at 0.94. Aim for under 0.9 for improved health markers.\nProgress photos, measurements, or body scans every 4 weeks.\n8. Hydration with Electrolytes\nSodium, potassium, and magnesium are crucial, especially if you sweat a lot during workouts or fasting. Consider adding an electrolyte mix to your water.\n9. Consistency is Key\nStick to your 2+1 weekly plan and focus on progressive overload in strength training.\nGradually increase weights or reps to stimulate muscle growth and fat loss over time.\nLet me know if you need tailored meal ideas, detailed recovery strategies, or further help optimizing your plan!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat was the workout plan again ? \nGet detailed \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\n2-Day Full-Body Strength Plan (With 1 Optional Cardio Day)\nThis plan is designed to maximize efficiency and results with just two strength sessions and one optional cardio session per week.

Let me know if you\u2019d like modifications!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nFrom the data presented, your health stats are generally positive with areas of potential improvement. Here's what stands out:\n\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV):\n\nHRV is at 70 ms, above your baseline of 68 ms. This is a good indicator of recovery and stress resilience.\nResting Heart Rate (RHR):\n\nYour RHR is 53 bpm, which is within a healthy range (51\u201365 bpm). A low RHR often indicates good cardiovascular fitness.\nRespiratory Rate:\n\nAt 11.9 breaths per minute, you are within the typical range. Stable breathing reflects good respiratory health.\nBlood Oxygen Levels:\n\nAt 93%, this is slightly below your baseline of 96% and could suggest areas to focus on, such as improving oxygenation through cardiovascular exercise or monitoring for any underlying issues.\nWrist Temperature:\n\nYour wrist temperature is slightly below the baseline, which is generally not a concern unless accompanied by other symptoms.\nRecommendations to Enhance Health:\nImprove Oxygen Saturation:\n\nFocus on deep breathing exercises or activities like yoga.\nEngage in regular aerobic exercises like brisk walking or cycling to enhance lung capacity.\nMaintain Cardiovascular Fitness:\n\nYour current RHR and HRV suggest good cardiovascular health. Continue with consistent workouts (even 2\u20133 times weekly) focusing on a mix of strength and cardio.\nHydration and Nutrition:\n\nProper hydration and balanced meals will optimize blood oxygen and recovery rates.\nSleep Optimization:\n\nEnsure consistent sleep patterns to further improve HRV and recovery.\nMonitor Trends:\n\nTrack changes in blood oxygen and other stats to identify any long-term trends that may need attention.\nIf you have specific concerns about any stat, feel free to share for a deeper dive!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nTell me more about blood oxygen \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nWhat Is Blood Oxygen Saturation?\nBlood oxygen saturation (SpO\u2082) measures the percentage of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in your blood compared to the total hemoglobin available. A healthy SpO\u2082 level typically ranges between 95% and 100%, depending on individual health, activity level, and altitude.\n\nWhy Does Blood Oxygen Matter?\nOxygen is vital for your body's energy production. If blood oxygen levels drop below normal, it may impact your overall energy, cognitive function, or even cardiovascular and respiratory health.\n\nYour Blood Oxygen (93%):\nYour current blood oxygen level of 93% is slightly below the baseline of 96%. While still within the functional range, it may indicate the following:\n\nTemporary Factors: Dehydration, stress, sleep, or even improper sensor readings (common for wearables).\nRespiratory Factors: Slight issues with oxygen intake or lung efficiency, especially if you're recovering from illness or not engaging in enough aerobic activity.\nCirculation: Blood flow efficiency might impact oxygenation.\nAltitude: If you've recently traveled to a higher altitude, it can cause lower oxygen saturation.\nWays to Improve Blood Oxygen:\nDeep Breathing Exercises:\n\nTechniques like diaphragmatic or box breathing can improve oxygenation and lung efficiency.\nAerobic Fitness:\n\nActivities like walking, running, cycling, or swimming help improve cardiovascular and lung capacity over time.\nStay Active:\n\nAvoid prolonged sedentary periods to improve circulation and oxygen delivery.\nHydration:\n\nStaying hydrated ensures smooth blood flow and efficient oxygen transport.\nEnvironment:\n\nEnsure adequate ventilation, especially when indoors. Low oxygen levels in poorly ventilated areas can affect your readings.\nShould You Be Concerned?\nIf you have no symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, or dizziness, a reading of 93% is not immediately alarming. However:\n\nIf you experience any unusual symptoms, it could be worth discussing with a healthcare provider.\nPersistent low readings (<92%) over several days might require attention, as it could indicate underlying respiratory or circulatory issues.\nWhen to Seek Help:\nContact a doctor if you notice:\n\nConsistently low readings (<90% at rest).\nDizziness, confusion, chest pain, or breathlessness.\nWould you like help setting up routines or tracking methods to monitor your levels over time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nMy gf also has low blood oxygen levels. But she is 39 weeks pregnant does that have an effect ?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, pregnancy, especially in the third trimester (like at 39 weeks), can influence blood oxygen levels due to several physiological changes in the body. Here\u2019s how pregnancy might affect blood oxygen:\n\n1. Changes in Respiratory Function:\nIncreased Oxygen Demand: The developing baby requires oxygen, increasing the mother's overall oxygen consumption.\nReduced Lung Volume: As the uterus expands, it pushes against the diaphragm, slightly reducing lung capacity. This can lead to a feeling of shallower breathing and potentially lower oxygen levels.\nHormonal Changes: Higher levels of progesterone stimulate breathing, which may lead to mild hyperventilation. This typically increases oxygen levels in the blood, but any inefficiencies in this process can cause slightly lower readings.\n2. Circulatory Changes:\nIncreased Blood Volume: Pregnancy increases the mother's blood volume by 30-50% to supply the baby. This can sometimes lead to mild dilution of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin.\nChanges in Blood Flow: Blood flow is redirected toward the uterus and placenta, which might impact oxygen delivery to other parts of the body.\n3. Natural Variation in Blood Oxygen Levels:\nSpO\u2082 readings of 93-95% can sometimes occur in healthy pregnant women, especially in late pregnancy, due to these physiological changes. However, levels below 92% at rest should be closely monitored.\nWhat to Watch For:\nNormal Pregnancy Symptoms: Mild shortness of breath or occasional tiredness can be common and usually not a concern.\nPotential Warning Signs:\nPersistent breathlessness at rest.\nDizziness, fainting, or confusion.\nSwelling in the legs with chest pain (could indicate a blood clot or other issue).\nSpO\u2082 consistently below 92%.\nIf any of these symptoms occur, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.\n\nTips to Support Healthy Oxygen Levels During Pregnancy:\nStay Active: Light activities like walking or prenatal yoga improve circulation and oxygen delivery.\nPractice Good Posture: Sitting or standing upright allows the diaphragm and lungs to expand better.\nDeep Breathing Exercises: Techniques like diaphragmatic breathing can increase oxygen intake.\nElevate While Sleeping: Propping the upper body slightly can help with breathing, especially in the third trimester.\nStay Hydrated: Proper hydration supports efficient blood circulation.\nIs This a Concern for Your Girlfriend?\nIf she is otherwise healthy and not experiencing symptoms like dizziness or difficulty breathing, her slightly lower oxygen levels may simply reflect normal pregnancy changes. However:\n\nRegular monitoring is recommended.\nIf levels dip below 90% or she feels unwell, seek medical advice promptly.\nWould you like a guide on breathing exercises or tips to improve comfort during this stage of pregnancy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nGreat what can I do as a dad to help during birth \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAs a dad-to-be, you play a crucial role in supporting your partner during childbirth.

Body Composition\nMetric\tValue\tInterpretation\nWeight\t86.6 kg\tWithin a healthy range for your frame, slightly above optimal for lean athletic performance.\nBMI\t26.1\tSlightly overweight by BMI standards, but this does not account for muscle mass.\nBody Fat %\t17.6%\tHealthy range (ideal for men: 10-18%). Lean but room for slight optimization.\nMuscle Mass\t41.2 kg\tStrong muscle base. Could optimize further with strength training.\nFat Mass\t15.2 kg\tGood range, but dropping fat to ~15% could enhance muscle definition.\nWater %\t60.5%\tNormal range (ideal for men: 55-65%). Good hydration.\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio\t0.96\tIndicates some central fat accumulation (ideal: \u22640.90).\nKey Takeaway:\nYour body fat percentage is in a solid range, but improving waist-to-hip ratio and dropping 1-2% more fat could optimize performance and health.\n\n2. Cardiovascular Health & Fitness\nMetric\tValue\tInterpretation\nVO2 Max\t54.3\tExcellent (Elite level for age 36).\nResting HR\t53 bpm\tStrong cardiovascular fitness (ideal: 50-60 bpm).\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV)\t70 ms\tHealthy recovery. Improving HRV can further optimize stress recovery.\nBlood Oxygen (SpO2)\t93%\tSlightly low (ideal: 95-99%). Could improve with breathwork, sleep, or checking for respiratory inefficiencies.\nKey Takeaway:\nYour VO2 Max is excellent, meaning your cardiovascular endurance is strong. However, low blood oxygen might suggest minor breathing inefficiencies or environmental factors. Resting HR is optimal, supporting good aerobic fitness.\n\n3. Workout Performance\nRecent Strength Training Session\nDuration: 1h 5 min\nCalories Burned: 562 kcal\nMax HR: 181 bpm\nAvg HR: 152 bpm\nTraining Intensity: Mostly Hard & Moderate zones\nHeart Rate Recovery (HRR): 43 bpm (decent, but improving HRR to 50+ bpm would indicate superior recovery).\n\u2705 Strength: Strong cardiovascular output and endurance.\n\u26a0\ufe0f Improvement Areas: HR recovery could be faster after intense efforts, and balancing high-intensity with some lower-impact sessions might improve overall fatigue management.\n\n4. Recovery & Fatigue\nMetric\tValue\tInterpretation\nTraining Impulse Score (TRIMP)\t146\tModerate training load.\nFatigue Score\t36\tElevated fatigue \u2013 suggests a need for better recovery.\nHRV Trend\t68 ms (avg)\tDecent, but improving it to 75+ ms may boost resilience.\nKey Takeaway:\nYour fatigue is high, meaning recovery strategies need focus\u2014especially with sleep, stress management, and active recovery.\n\nAction Plan for Optimization\nFat Loss & Body Composition\n\nTarget 15% body fat for better muscle definition.\nMaintain lean muscle mass (~41 kg) with progressive overload in training.\nReduce waist-to-hip ratio (aim <0.90) via lower abdominal/core-focused workouts.\nCardiovascular Performance\n\nMaintain VO2 Max (54.3 is excellent!) by keeping up with aerobic training.\nImprove heart rate recovery by adding low-intensity Zone 2 sessions (1x per week).\nStrength & Training Adjustments\n\nOptimize training balance: More mobility/recovery work to offset fatigue.\nHR Recovery Goal: Improve from 43 bpm \u2192 50+ bpm with active cooldowns & stress reduction.\nRecovery & Fatigue Management\n\nImprove HRV: Prioritize sleep, deep breathing, cold exposure, and mobility work.\nLower Fatigue (36 \u2192 <30) by adding a deload week every 4-6 weeks.\nBlood Oxygen Improvement (93% \u2192 95%+)\n\nSleep hygiene: Ensure deep sleep & no sleep apnea.\nBreathwork training (Wim Hof-style or nasal breathing exercises).\nSummary of Priorities\n\u2705 Keep doing:\n\u2714\ufe0e Strength & cardio balance (2x/week)\n\u2714\ufe0e VO2 Max optimization\n\u2714\ufe0e Hydration (60.5% water level is solid)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Improve:\n\u26a1 Fatigue recovery \u2192 Increase HRV & better sleep\n\u26a1 HR Recovery (43 bpm) \u2192 More low-intensity cardio & cooldowns\n\u26a1 Body composition (17.6% \u2192 ~15% fat) \u2192 Improve waist-to-hip ratio\n\u26a1 Blood Oxygen (93%) \u2192 Better breathing practices & check sleep quality\n\nWould you like any refinements in training, recovery, or diet?
