Sven also runs Seven ApS (his consultancy since 2016) and serves as Project Manager at ALLIGN, a construction-tech SaaS platform.\n\n**Personal context**\n\nSven is a Danish entrepreneur and \"AI-first hacker-consultant\" with a decade of startup experience across companies like Barry Energy, JABII, and Bright Star Studios. He's a guest lecturer at DTU, conducts AI workshops, and describes himself as a \"huge AI nerd\" who was \"vibe coding\" with AI before it became mainstream. His tagline is \"I Connect Dots, Brains & Bots.\"\n\n**Top of mind**\n\nSven is actively developing interactive React components for Atlas Intelligence's landing pages, including a sophisticated \"House of Cards\" visualization and AI agent demonstrations. He's preparing for the \"Agents & \u00c6bleskiver\" workshop on December 17th, featuring live AI agent demos and hands-on sessions. Current technical work includes WhatsApp agent development for RTT (taxi industry automation), 6DEGREES recruiting platform with LinkedIn network pathfinding, and various n8n automation workflows. He's also managing team coordination for ALLIGN project development and preparing AI workshop content for multiple Danish organizations.\n\n**Brief history**\n\n*Recent months*\n\nSven has been heavily focused on Atlas Intelligence business development, conducting comprehensive market research on Nordic AI consulting landscape and developing AgentKit, their library of production-ready automation agents. He delivered a successful 30,000 DKK AI transformation workshop for VMS Group, achieving 83% reduction in service report processing time and 32% freed capital through inventory optimization. Major projects include the Danbolig Meta automation pilot for real estate franchises, KODA Performance Discovery for music rights tracking, and Source Angel B2B lead intelligence systems. He's been actively managing international development teams for ALLIGN while addressing significant technical debt issues discovered through code reviews.\n\n*Earlier context*\n\nSven established Atlas Intelligence as a rebranding from \"Atlas Data & AI,\" positioning the company as Denmark's first-mover in \"Responsible Automation.\" He developed comprehensive business plans and GTM strategies, focusing on medium to large Nordic enterprises with document-heavy workflows. Key achievements included building DroneWatch 2.0 for Jyllands-Posten, creating UTM Tracker & B2B Attribution Dashboard, and conducting AI analysis that helped startups secure funding.

TODO: Sven beskriver dashboard-vision.", "project_memories": {"0199a470-bf14-747e-a606-2dfe7b3ad930": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven runs Seven Consult ApS, an AI automation consultancy specializing in workflow optimization using tools like N8N. With 10+ years of tech startup experience at companies like Barry (energy) and Brightstar (gaming), he has spent the last 3 years building production AI systems for maritime services, offshore recruitment, and tech startups. Currently on parental leave at 50% capacity until December 2025, returning to full availability in January 2026. He deliberately takes only 2-3 projects simultaneously to ensure quality delivery and proper knowledge transfer to clients.\n\nHis approach emphasizes building systems that clients can maintain themselves rather than creating dependency. Key differentiators include multi-modal AI expertise (combining web scraping, vision analysis, and reasoning models) and proven ROI delivery - like the VMS Maritime project where he built an AI system analyzing ship motor photos against PDF manuals, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours and preventing costly equipment purchases.\n\n**Current state**\n\nActively working on a lead intelligence automation project for Source Angel ApS (clients Henning H\u00f8rstrup and Morten), valued at 20,000 DKK with 50/50 payment structure. The system will scrape Danish job sites (The Hub, Jobindex, LinkedIn Jobs, TechSavvy) to identify tech companies with 2+ IT positions and 5-200 employees, specifically filtering out companies with existing Eastern European teams - a critical dealbreaker for the offshore staffing business.\n\nProject documentation is complete including GDPR-compliant Data Processing Agreement, kickoff webforms for client data collection, and comprehensive technical specifications. The system uses N8N workflows with HubSpot integration, designed to reduce client research time from 15-20 hours weekly to approximately 2 hours.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nStrategic positioning through scarcity works better than apologetic availability constraints - limited November slots became a compelling differentiator rather than a weakness. Technical credibility must be balanced with business value; excessive technical detail can overwhelm clients while concrete ROI calculations (like demonstrating 77,000 DKK monthly savings) resonate strongly.\n\nLegal compliance research proved crucial - Bright Data's 2024 court victories against Meta and X transformed LinkedIn scraping from legally questionable to defensible and recommended. Client communication style matters significantly; formal responses needed consistent adjustment to match Sven's casual, direct Danish business approach.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nPrefers phased project delivery with clear exit criteria and satisfaction guarantees. Uses proof-of-concept approaches (Phase 1) before expanding to full intelligence layers and outreach automation. Maintains intellectual property rights tied to payment completion - system ownership only transfers after 100% payment received.\n\nCommunication style is notably casual and direct, consistently requesting \"less AI-like\" formatting without emojis or excessive formality. Values action-oriented messaging with \"mindre fokus p\u00e5 betaling\" (less focus on payment) and emphasizes practical next steps over elaborate explanations.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nPrimary technical stack centers on N8N for workflow automation, with HubSpot integration for CRM functionality. Uses Bright Data API for LinkedIn scraping (legally defensible post-2024 court victories), Google Sheets for data output, and self-hosted infrastructure on client servers for GDPR compliance.\n\nCharges 750 DKK/hour for ongoing support with 10-hour monthly caps after initial 30-day support periods. Leverages ReportLab for professional PDF generation and maintains comprehensive documentation workflows using MCP filesystem tools for iterative document development.", "019977c3-3f66-7686-a816-c50ffef42a15": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is building Allign, a construction industry SaaS platform targeting Danish/Scandinavian markets at approximately 250 DKK per user per month. The platform combines time tracking, project management, and tender price negotiation automation with a mobile-first approach optimized for construction workers using devices with gloves in outdoor conditions. Key collaborators include Thomas (construction industry stakeholder with 1 million DKK budget authority), David Fischer and Isak Small (team members), Alexander from Atlas Consulting (technical lead for refactoring), and various international development teams.\n\nThe project represents a critical business opportunity requiring seamless functionality for field workers while competing in the Scandinavian construction management market. Success depends on delivering a production-ready platform that consolidates multiple construction industry systems into one intuitive solution, with particular emphasis on email integration for supplier negotiations and project case management.\n\n**Current state**\n\nSven is managing a complex technical crisis following an independent code review by Alexander that revealed severe architectural problems in the existing codebase. The Pakistan development team's work contained approximately 20% dead code, zero unit tests, exposed API keys, 268 hardcoded colors despite existing design systems, and over-engineering for an MVP stage. Critical authentication issues have created a 17-day stalemate blocking user access, with fundamental problems like email verification URLs still pointing to localhost.\n\nCurrently coordinating parallel development streams: Alexander's team handling comprehensive refactoring over 2-3 months, while evaluating whether to continue with remediated Pakistan team work or transition entirely to higher-quality alternatives. The platform has completed core modules for authentication, time tracking, offline GPS functionality, and project management, but requires extensive architectural cleanup before production deployment.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nPreparing for critical stakeholder meetings to present refactoring recommendations and secure budget approval for proper technical foundation work. Planning customer rollout for Q1 2026 following completion of refactoring phase and mail client integration. Evaluating long-term partnership structures including potential equity discussions around 10% stakes and budget allocations approaching 800,000 DKK for comprehensive platform development.\n\nConsidering expansion of the mail client module scope and integration with AI-powered workflow automation across 20+ platform modules. Strategic decisions pending around team composition, development timelines, and whether to rebuild foundations versus extensive refactoring approaches.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nTechnical debt compounds rapidly and proper architecture accelerates future development rather than delaying it. \"Done\" status in project management systems doesn't guarantee actual functionality - independent verification through testing and code review is essential. Over-engineering for enterprise features when building MVPs creates fundamental scalability and security risks, particularly around multi-tenancy with sensitive competitor data.\n\nQuality assurance failures create systemic accountability problems where teams mark work complete without meeting acceptance criteria. Professional scoping and documentation prove valuable regardless of which team ultimately implements features, providing implementation-ready specifications for competitive evaluation. Field worker usability requires radical simplicity with large touch targets, light themes for outdoor visibility, and offline functionality that handles realistic data volumes rather than small test datasets.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nSven employs evidence-based project management using Linear ticket tracking, comprehensive code reviews, and systematic verification of completion claims against actual deliverables. Maintains parallel development strategies with backup teams as insurance while requiring concrete deliverables and firm deadlines. Communication style emphasizes direct, actionable guidance over diplomatic deflection, particularly when addressing performance issues.\n\nStructures stakeholder communications with clear sections for budget, timeline, roles, and next steps, adapting tone from formal business language to casual team messaging based on audience. Prioritizes transparency about technical problems over overselling capabilities, using specific evidence from technical reviews to support business decisions. Implements strict accountability measures with daily progress updates, clear documentation requirements, and automatic escalation triggers for continued delays.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nPrimary project management through Linear for issue tracking and milestone management, with Notion for comprehensive documentation and meeting notes. Uses Supabase for backend infrastructure, Next.js and React for frontend development, and PostgreSQL for database management. GitHub for code repository management with MCP integration for accountability documentation.\n\nRegular collaboration with Atlas Consulting for technical architecture guidance and code quality assessment. Maintains relationships with multiple international development teams across Pakistan and Bulgaria for capacity and quality comparison. Leverages Google Drive for document sharing and WhatsApp for team coordination, particularly with international developers across different time zones.", "019939b4-83dc-7281-83ad-f08e6d525563": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is CEO and co-founder of Atlas Intelligence ApS, a Danish AI consultancy established as a 50/50 joint venture between Atlas Consulting (a 7-year regenerative business consultancy) and his AI automation expertise. Atlas Intelligence is positioned with locked messaging: \"Ansvarlig AI. M\u00e5lbar v\u00e6rdi. Data du kan stole p\u00e5\" with the hero statement \"Fra datakaos til beslutningskraft.\" The company targets Danish organizations needing responsible AI implementation with governance and transparency, explicitly contrasting with \"move fast and break things\" approaches.\n\nThe venture combines Atlas Consulting's enterprise relationships and human-centered design philosophy with Sven's proven AI delivery capabilities. Key stakeholders include Daniel Borre B\u00f8bel (Atlas Consulting CEO), Louise (workshop promotion), and technical collaborators Eric and William. Atlas Intelligence operates with a clear ICP prioritization: maritime/shipping (Q1 focus), construction (Q2), and public sector (Q3+), leveraging existing relationships with VMS Maritime and construction industry clients.\n\nSuccess is measured through concrete outcomes: 85% time savings (ALLIGN's CV screening from 15 hours to 2 hours weekly), risk analysis acceleration from weeks to hours (VMS Maritime), and positioning as Denmark's first \"responsible AI\" consultancy. The company addresses urgent market timing with EU AI Act compliance deadlines: prohibitions effective February 2025, governance requirements August 2025, and full infrastructure compliance by August 2026.\n\n**Current state**\n\nAtlas Intelligence has moved from negotiation to active execution with proven revenue generation including a \u20ac20K RTT deal and strong pipeline momentum (100K DKK proposals sent, 180K DKK pipeline). The team operates on 14-day delivery cadences with Sven full-time, Daniel contributing 2 days weekly on sales, Eric at 50% capacity, and William transitioning to full-time based on revenue sustainability.\n\nThe company has finalized comprehensive go-to-market materials including website copy, case studies, and sales collateral. The three-tier service offering is locked: Overblik (2-week readiness assessment), Fundament (6-week data foundation), and Automatisering (10-12 week full automation implementation). All materials emphasize outcome-focused Danish naming and positioning around datasuver\u00e6nitet and governance-first approaches.\n\nCurrent focus includes completing the 5-page website (Forside, S\u00e5dan arbejder vi, Cases, Om os, Kontakt) with established brand guidelines (sage green #587474, warm beige #F1EAD8, off-white #F4F1EA), finalizing anonymized case studies for external use, and executing maritime sector outreach as Q1 priority.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nAtlas Intelligence is preparing for systematic market expansion following the established ICP sequence: maritime/shipping dominance in Q1, construction sector penetration in Q2, and public sector engagement Q3+. The company is developing productized offerings including Agent Kit development and potential AVM (Automated Valuation Model) Core platform for Q2-Q3 2026.\n\nStrategic initiatives include building thought leadership content around the 5-layer vs 3-layer data architecture advantage over competitors like Databricks, developing EU AI Act compliance frameworks mapped to Articles 10, 11, and 12, and establishing partnership networks with legal firms for comprehensive compliance offerings.\n\nThe team is planning Nordic expansion leveraging the responsible AI positioning, with particular focus on government procurement opportunities through Denmark's AI Regulatory Sandbox program and the 800M DKK government AI initiative funding through 2027.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nAtlas Intelligence has established core operational principles around \"ansvarlig automation\" - responsible automation that maintains human control and transparency. The company's \"Atlas Intelligence Standard\" emphasizes four non-negotiables: sporbarhed (traceability), human-in-the-loop processes, datadisciplin (data discipline), and effektm\u00e5ling (impact measurement).\n\nKey market insights include Denmark's 28% AI adoption rate (double EU average) creating sophisticated demand, while 95% of AI projects fail at pilot stage due to governance gaps. The EU AI Act compliance deadline creates urgent 6-12 month market window, with Atlas positioned uniquely to address both technical implementation and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe partnership model has proven that combining established consulting credibility with specialized AI expertise creates premium positioning. The \"zero-new-interface\" philosophy - integrating AI into existing Teams/WhatsApp/CRM tools rather than requiring new systems - has demonstrated strong client adoption and reduced implementation friction.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nAtlas Intelligence operates through a gate-based methodology where clients can stop at any phase, building trust through incremental value delivery. The approach emphasizes \"Quick POC. Builds trust. Increases conversion. Built to last\" - rapid proof-of-concept development that demonstrates value while building production-ready foundations.\n\nThe company follows a governance-first implementation strategy, establishing audit trails and compliance frameworks from day one rather than retrofitting governance later. This differentiates from typical \"pilot-then-scale\" approaches that often fail at production deployment.\n\nSales and delivery processes center on outcome-focused messaging with specific metrics and time savings rather than technical features. Case studies are systematically developed with concrete results, then anonymized for external use while maintaining impact credibility.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nAtlas Intelligence leverages Atlas Consulting's established brand guidelines, client relationships, and regenerative business methodology as foundational infrastructure. Technical delivery utilizes proven AI platforms while building custom governance and explainability layers.\n\nThe company maintains comprehensive marketing materials including brand-aligned website specifications, professional one-pagers, and case study templates. All materials follow established visual identity with specific color palettes, typography systems (Archivo Black for headings, Abel Pro for body text), and Nordic minimalist aesthetic.\n\nEU AI Act compliance frameworks are mapped to specific articles and requirements, providing structured guidance for client implementations. The company references Danish government AI initiatives and regulatory sandbox programs as credibility anchors and potential partnership opportunities.", "0198a7aa-9097-709c-8d9a-c94d52e17e69": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is a consultant working with ALLIGN, a Danish construction software startup, managing the development of their construction management platform. The platform aims to optimize profit for construction companies through AI-powered features like automated price negotiations during tender processes. Key collaborators include David Fischer (ALLIGN director), Isak Small, and development partners including a Pakistan-based team (led by Zulqarnain) handling MVP development and Delta Forge Ltd (Bulgaria) for specialized module development. The project involves building approximately 20-21 modules with a total budget of 300-400k DKK, using a Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel tech stack with multi-tenant RBAC architecture.\n\n**Current state**\n\nSven is actively transitioning from hourly time-and-materials contracts to fixed-price milestone-based arrangements, driven by investor requirements and significant budget mismatches between development teams. He's managing contract modifications between LNW Entreprise ApS (Denmark) and Delta Forge Ltd (Bulgaria), including jurisdiction changes to England and Wales, switching to Linear for time tracking, and implementing weekly reporting structures. The Pakistan team continues handling MVP work while Delta Forge focuses on specialized modules like the Mail Client, which must integrate with existing ALLIGN codebase and include AI features within a 50K DKK budget constraint.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nThe email client module serves as the immediate test case for the new fixed-price contract structure, with plans to scope detailed technical requirements before finalizing pricing. Future modules will follow the same fixed-price milestone approach, with past work remaining under time-and-materials billing. Sven is coordinating domain setup for Pakistan's Vercel deployment and managing the transition between development teams while maintaining platform continuity.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nFixed-price contracts provide essential budget predictability and risk mitigation compared to hourly arrangements, especially when facing significant cost variations between development teams. Detailed technical scoping before contract finalization creates value regardless of which team ultimately executes the work. Direct, honest feedback and firm accountability measures are more effective than accommodating deflection patterns from development teams. Quality cannot be compromised for speed, and critical technical debt must be addressed before production deployment.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nSven uses Linear for issue tracking and project management, coordinates through weekly milestones with daily status updates, and maintains systematic task management with clear status reporting. He prefers direct, collaborative communication over formal corporate language while still enforcing accountability. Contract negotiations involve two-phase approaches: initial scoping payments followed by fixed-price agreements based on detailed specifications. He manages multiple development teams across different time zones while ensuring code quality through comprehensive reviews addressing security, architecture, and process issues.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nPrimary tools include Linear for project management, WhatsApp for team communication, Vercel for deployment, and document generation workflows using pandoc and wkhtmltopdf for professional contract formatting. The platform uses Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel stack with multi-tenant RBAC architecture, requiring GDPR compliance and AI-ready features for construction industry applications.", "0197785a-2f2a-71cd-ab29-1aa51e6ee545": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is building authority in the Danish AI/tech market through his personal brand SEVEN and co-founded delivery company Atlas Intelligence (with partners Daniel and Louise). His core mission is establishing himself as Denmark's leading AI automation expert, moving from startup builder to recognized thought leader. He's evolved from \"Connected AI Implementation Expert\" positioning to \"Infrastructure Sensemaker\" with a \"Build Your Infrastructure\" (BYI) philosophy - helping companies replace expensive SaaS sprawl with owned, integrated systems.\n\nKey network connections include Danish AI influencers Anders B\u00e6k, David Guldager, and Kwadwo, whom he leverages for market penetration and amplification. His hero case study is ALLIGN, where Atlas Intelligence replaced a 100K DKK monthly SaaS stack with an integrated owned system, achieving 65% cost reduction. Success metrics target \u20ac1 million annual revenue and recognized thought leadership, with current progress showing strong LinkedIn engagement and viral content performance.\n\n**Current state**\n\nSven is actively implementing a distribution-first strategy inspired by Ben Tossell's playbook, adapted for the Danish market. He's launching a bi-weekly Danish-language newsletter targeting initial 1,000 subscribers through network activation, while building authority through LinkedIn content and podcast appearances. His \"Weekly Ship\" growth engine involves documenting one project per week from idea to production, rebranded as the \"BYI Series\" to reinforce category ownership.\n\nAtlas Intelligence operates across three proven domains: construction (reducing candidate screening from 15 hours to 2 hours weekly), maritime (reducing engine assessments from weeks to hours), and lead intelligence (automated scoring with decision briefs). The business architecture has Sven handling pipeline and demos, Daniel managing delivery and quality, Louise overseeing operations, with Atlas Consulting providing enterprise relationships.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nThe 12-month roadmap progresses from current newsletter launch to authority building through strategic content and network leverage, culminating in monetization through sponsorships, consulting, and premium products. Revenue projections suggest \u20ac3,000-5,000 monthly blended revenue by month 12, with Nordic-wide expansion planned to overcome Denmark's smaller population constraints.\n\nUpcoming initiatives include BYI audits, AI tools directory, workshop sponsorships, and a potential \"Ship 30 Things in 30 Days\" challenge to demonstrate execution authority. The strategy accounts for Danish market preferences including detailed benefits over emotional appeals and high trust culture requirements.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nCore philosophy centers on \"Stop planning, start building\" with anti-perfectionist, execution-first approach. Sven has learned that business transformation messaging outperforms technical jargon, and that authentic Danish directness can be leveraged as competitive advantage when framed as cutting through startup complexity. The ALLIGN case study proved that owned systems can dramatically outperform SaaS sprawl both economically and functionally.\n\nKey insight: the Danish market lacks a personality-driven curator in the Ben Tossell mold, creating a clear opportunity gap. Contrarian positioning achieves significantly higher engagement, and action-oriented content with specific metrics performs better than generic advice. The barrier isn't technical capability but daring to ship imperfect solutions quickly.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nSven's methodology follows a \"Sprint to Demo\" approach (2-4 weeks), followed by Automation and AI-agent development (4-12 weeks), then ongoing Operations with accountability. His content strategy involves three weekly LinkedIn post types: Infrastructure Audit, BYI Build Log, and Infrastructure Philosophy, combined with strategic \"reply guy\" tactics on social media.\n\nDecision-making framework prioritizes rapid execution over lengthy planning cycles, with 48-hour delivery promises as a competitive differentiator. Network activation involves systematic engagement with key Danish AI influencers, while content multiplication spans LinkedIn, newsletter, and potential podcast appearances. The approach emphasizes building in public, sharing both successes and failures for authentic positioning.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nPrimary platforms include LinkedIn for thought leadership, Beehiiv for newsletter distribution with referral mechanics, and MCPHub.dev website for technical credibility. Sven leverages Bright Data MCP for comprehensive market research and maintains strategic partnerships through Atlas Consulting for enterprise relationships.\n\nKey reference models include Ben Tossell's distribution-first playbook, Anders B\u00e6k's authority-building methodology through early market predictions, and Marc Lou's revenue transparency approach. The Danish Tech Startups Slack community and existing newsletters like TechSavvy Weekly provide market context and competitive intelligence.", "01997159-7f18-7357-ab18-f768b4a4e424": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is developing a comprehensive Danish meal planning system designed for Danish families to create vegetarian-based meal plans with optional meat add-ons, compare prices across major Danish grocery stores (Netto, REMA 1000, Bilka, Lidl, SuperBrugsen), and optimize shopping costs. The project aims to help families make informed decisions about meal planning while managing food budgets effectively. The system balances practical meal planning with cost optimization, incorporating Danish culinary preferences and local grocery store ecosystems.\n\n**Current state**\n\nThe Danish Meal Planner project is actively hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/Arnarsson/danish-meal-planner and has evolved into \"DanishMealPlannerPro.jsx\" with enhanced functionality. The current system includes a comprehensive React application with family configuration, 7-day meal planning, shopping list generation, price comparison across Danish stores, macro calculations, and CSV export capabilities. Three major \"killer features\" have been successfully implemented: a Memory System using LocalStorage with persistent data storage across eight different data stores, a comprehensive Meal Bank containing 20+ pre-configured Danish meals (balanced between vegetarian and meat options) with detailed nutritional information and ratings, and Reality Tracking functionality that compares planned versus actual meals with compliance analytics and insights.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nThe development process revealed that large React components require strategic handling when uploading to GitHub - using create_or_update_file with base64 encoding proves more reliable than batch push operations for files exceeding API limits. The meal planning system benefits significantly from persistent data storage, with LocalStorage providing an effective solution for maintaining user preferences, meal history, and family configurations without requiring external databases. Danish families respond well to vegetarian-first meal planning with optional meat additions, and comprehensive price comparison across multiple grocery chains adds substantial value to the planning process.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nDevelopment follows an iterative enhancement approach, starting with core functionality and progressively adding sophisticated features like memory systems, meal banks, and analytics. The system architecture separates concerns effectively with distinct data stores for family configuration, weekly plans, meal history, favorites, and shopping history. GitHub repository management involves creating proper project structure with configuration files, documentation, and logical file organization before implementing major feature additions.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nThe project utilizes React 18.2.0 as the primary framework with Tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide React for icons. GitHub serves as the code repository with MCP tools handling file operations and repository management. The system integrates with Danish grocery store pricing data and includes comprehensive meal databases with nutritional information. LocalStorage provides persistent data management, while the application includes smart shopping list generation and compliance tracking analytics.", "019a1b93-66ac-756a-be81-770715ad6466": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is building a new company in partnership with Atlas Group/Atlas Consult, focusing on AI transformation workshops and consulting services for Danish businesses, particularly in the financial sector. The primary objective is developing AI solutions that enhance rather than replace human expertise - what he calls \"Responsible AI\" - positioning AI as a practical tool that eliminates administrative work so people can focus on relationship-building and strategic tasks.\n\nKey collaborators include Daniel from Atlas Consulting (who facilitates client introductions), Eric (co-developer of AI proposals), and Henning (client for lead generation system). The work targets established Danish companies, especially IT consulting firms and financial sector clients including banks and pension funds, with a focus on demonstrating concrete, measurable results rather than theoretical AI capabilities.\n\nSven's approach emphasizes workshop-based engagement starting with 2-day sessions that produce working prototypes within 3 weeks, avoiding lengthy specification processes. Success is measured through specific time savings, efficiency gains, and ROI calculations, with recent VMS Group workshop generating 1,159% ROI and saving 700+ hours annually. The business model centers on building trust through immediate, tangible results that lead to larger automation projects.\n\n**Current state**\n\nSven is actively preparing for a critical one-hour workshop with Zenit Consult A/S, a 27-year-old Danish IT consulting placement firm managing 1,400+ consultants with $269M revenue. This represents a significant business development opportunity, with comprehensive presentation materials developed including speaker notes, slide content, and strategic positioning around knowledge preservation and scaling expertise through AI-assisted consultant matching.\n\nRecent successful case studies are being leveraged as proof points, particularly the VMS Group automotive company workshop that produced four AI solutions: automated motor data comparison (reducing 1-hour tasks to 2-3 minutes), intelligent warranty case analysis, optimized inventory management, and automated service reports. The Allign construction platform case study is also being refined, showcasing the complete development journey from prototype to production-ready solution scheduled for Q1 2026 rollout.\n\nCurrent presentation development focuses on three core service models: prototype-to-production workflows, internal AI optimization, and intelligent database matching systems. Materials are being prepared in Danish with emphasis on concrete metrics, storytelling over technical specifications, and positioning AI as a tool rather than replacement technology.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nThe Zenit Consult workshop represents a potential gateway to larger financial sector opportunities, with follow-up possibilities ranging from 90-day pilots to full automation suites. Domain registration decisions are pending for atlaskonsulting.dk or atlasintelligence.dk as the business structure solidifies.\n\nPipeline development includes expanding the lead generation AI agent system being built for Henning, featuring automated job site scraping, LinkedIn intelligence, and outreach assistance with phases totaling around 25,000 DKK. Additional opportunities are emerging through the Atlas Group partnership network, particularly targeting companies with manual, data-driven processes that could benefit from AI optimization.\n\nFuture workshop concepts are being developed around knowledge preservation themes, especially relevant for established companies facing leadership transitions or scaling challenges. The approach of demonstrating working prototypes in 3 weeks rather than lengthy planning phases is being positioned as a key differentiator in the Danish market.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nA fundamental insight driving Sven's approach is that AI should be presented as \"et v\u00e6rkt\u00f8j - et virkelig imponerende v\u00e6rkt\u00f8j\" (a tool - a really impressive tool) rather than magic or hype. The most effective positioning focuses on AI as pattern recognition technology that handles repetitive, data-driven tasks while freeing humans for strategic thinking and relationship work.\n\nWorkshop success depends on producing immediate, tangible results rather than theoretical discussions. The VMS Group case proved that skeptical audiences can be transformed into enthusiastic adopters when they see working solutions that solve real problems. Concrete metrics resonate more than features - showing 95% time savings on specific tasks carries more weight than technical capabilities.\n\nQuality-focused clients like Zenit require extensive fail guards and human-in-the-loop design to address concerns about AI compromising their reputation for precision. The \"Responsible AI\" messaging has emerged as a crucial differentiator, especially in the financial sector where trust and compliance are paramount.\n\nPresentation effectiveness improves dramatically when monetary values are removed in favor of time savings and efficiency gains. Audiences connect better with \"700+ hours per year freed up\" than ROI percentages, and storytelling beats slide-reading for maintaining engagement.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nSven's methodology centers on workshop-based engagement starting with 2-day intensive sessions that identify specific use cases and build working prototypes within 3 weeks. This approach bypasses traditional lengthy specification processes and demonstrates value immediately, reducing client risk and building trust through tangible results.\n\nResearch and preparation are thorough, involving comprehensive competitive analysis, client background investigation, and strategic positioning development. For the Zenit engagement, this included detailed market intelligence on Danish IT consulting placement firms, understanding their business model differences from traditional consultancies, and identifying specific operational challenges around consultant matching scalability.\n\nPresentation development follows a structured approach: problem identification with concrete examples, solution demonstration with specific metrics, and risk mitigation through gradual rollout phases and quality assurance systems. Materials are developed in multiple formats (speaker notes, slide content, infographics) and refined based on audience feedback and context requirements.\n\nThe business development process emphasizes relationship-building through introductions (like Daniel's facilitation with Zenit) and leverages successful case studies as proof points for new opportunities. Each engagement is designed to demonstrate immediate value while positioning for larger, longer-term automation projects.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nPresentation development utilizes comprehensive toolkits including HTML slide generation for visualization, Python matplotlib for high-quality infographic creation, and structured markdown documentation for organizing complex project materials. The MCP file creation system effectively manages multi-section documents and presentation materials.\n\nResearch capabilities include web search tools for competitive intelligence, company background investigation, and market analysis. Danish-specific searches require targeted approaches combining local business directories, professional networks, and industry publications for comprehensive market intelligence.\n\nCase study development draws from real client engagements like VMS Group and Allign, with detailed documentation of specific solutions, time savings, and implementation approaches. These serve as reusable proof points across different client presentations while maintaining confidentiality requirements.\n\nThe Atlas Group partnership provides client introduction capabilities and collaborative proposal development, expanding reach into the Danish financial sector and established business networks.", "019638b1-369c-7530-aa25-09abca9274a3": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is building comprehensive automation systems using n8n workflow automation, with a primary focus on lead generation pipelines for Danish IT companies and social media management solutions.

Sven values manual approval workflows over fully automated outreach, emphasizing data quality and CRM hygiene. He operates with specific constraints including monthly operational costs under 300 DKK and requirements for complete code ownership on self-hosted infrastructure.\n\n**Current state**\n\nSven is actively working on multiple n8n automation projects with varying completion states. His lead generation pipeline system has four phases: Phase 1 (nightly job board scraping) is built but experiencing validation errors, Phase 2 (LinkedIn intelligence) has critical webhook and expression syntax issues, while Phases 3 and 4 are deployment-ready. He's also completed a comprehensive social media automation system for Danbolig with separate Instagram and Facebook workflows using Meta API webhooks, Google Sheets configuration management, and n8n processing. Current technical challenges include resolving deprecated error handling properties, fixing webhook response modes, and addressing API connectivity issues with external services like Bright Data MCP integration.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nSven is planning to expand his automation capabilities with additional lead generation features including Eastern European team detection (described as a business dealbreaker), LinkedIn network mapping for warm introductions, and AI-powered outreach assistance with manual approval gates. He's exploring Bright Data API integration for more reliable web scraping with anti-bot protection and rotating IPs. Future development includes scaling the social media automation system across multiple accounts and implementing comprehensive error handling with Slack notifications for unattended operations.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nSven has established core principles around manual approval workflows rather than fully automated outreach, emphasizing the importance of CRM hygiene and avoiding pollution with unqualified leads. He's learned that n8n validation issues often stem from deprecated properties (like conflicting `continueOnFail` and `onError` settings) rather than workflow logic problems. His experience shows that robust error handling with retry logic, rate limiting, and comprehensive logging is essential for unattended nightly operations. He prioritizes getting reliable foundations working before adding intelligence layers, following a \"validate and activate Phase 1 before building Phase 2\" approach.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nSven follows a structured methodology for n8n development: template search first, then node discovery, architecture design, and comprehensive validation before deployment. He prefers parallel tool execution over sequential operations for efficiency and implements multi-stage filtering and data normalization in his workflows. His development pattern emphasizes fixing validation errors systematically, using batch operations for API efficiency, and implementing comprehensive logging to Google Sheets for monitoring and debugging. He consistently requests direct execution rather than extensive discussion, preferring autonomous implementation with minimal back-and-forth.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nSven extensively uses n8n-MCP integration tools for workflow creation, validation, and deployment, with his n8n instance hosted at n8n.svenarnarsson.com. His technical stack includes Google Sheets for data storage and configuration management, Meta Graph API for social media automation, Gmail integration for outreach, Slack for error notifications, and OpenAI GPT-4 for AI-generated content. He leverages Bright Data API for web scraping with anti-bot protection, HubSpot for CRM integration via webhooks, and maintains comprehensive documentation in ~/Desktop/MCP/n8n-workflows/ directory. His workflows consistently use environment variables for API keys and configuration, with specific patterns for error handling, rate limiting, and data validation.", "019a965b-6060-7027-9fe4-a3954b927856": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is a Partner & Co-Founder at Atlas Intelligence focused on lead generation automation and business development.

He's exploring ways to improve the system's intelligence through better tech stack detection, strategic insights generation, and enhanced priority scoring based on multi-platform presence. Future development includes refining the operational procedures and training materials to enable better team scaling and knowledge transfer across his organization.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nThrough extensive workflow development, Sven has learned that native API integrations (like Bright Data nodes) significantly outperform manual HTTP requests, providing better reliability and type safety. HTML extraction with CSS selectors delivers 95% accuracy compared to 70% with markdown parsing approaches. Proper error handling, centralized configuration management, and systematic logging are essential for production workflows. AI extraction requires source-specific prompts and validation systems to maintain data quality. Deduplication across multiple sources is critical, as it can reduce duplicates from 25% to under 5%. Visual organization and comprehensive documentation are crucial for team collaboration and workflow maintenance.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nSven follows a systematic approach to workflow development, starting with analysis of existing systems and identifying specific improvement opportunities. He prioritizes creating both quick-win solutions (10-minute implementations for 50% improvement) and comprehensive overhauls (complete transformations for 90% improvement). His workflows use parallel processing architectures with centralized configuration nodes, strategic wait times to avoid rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling. He emphasizes creating detailed documentation including technical specifications, visual build guides, implementation checklists, and Standard Operating Procedures to enable team scaling and consistent execution.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nSven's technical stack centers on n8n for workflow automation, Bright Data for web scraping with specific zones and proxy configurations, and PostgreSQL for data storage with custom schemas and indexing. He uses AI extraction nodes with custom system messages and validation rules, JavaScript transformation for data processing, and integration with Gmail and Slack for notifications and reporting. His development process relies heavily on JSON workflow files, comprehensive documentation systems, and MCP directory organization for file management. He maintains various API credentials and tokens for service integrations, with established patterns for secure credential management within n8n's system.", "019ac60a-a2d2-7028-b621-74fe1c7b7fd5": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is building an AI-driven recruitment platform that leverages network effects to find optimal connection paths between candidates and opportunities - essentially \"warm intros at scale.\" The platform's core functionality involves mapping professional networks to identify the shortest documented pathways between individuals, particularly for high-value connections like reaching executives, investors, or influential figures. This work sits at the intersection of recruitment technology, network analysis, and relationship mapping, with applications spanning executive search, business development, and strategic networking.\n\nThe platform addresses a fundamental challenge in professional networking: moving beyond cold outreach to leverage existing relationships for meaningful introductions. Success is measured by the platform's ability to identify verifiable connection paths and facilitate authentic relationship-building rather than generic outreach.\n\n**Current state**\n\nSven is actively developing and demonstrating the platform's network analysis capabilities through real-world case studies. Recent work has focused on mapping connection paths from various Danish and Nordic professionals to high-profile figures like Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. These analyses serve both as product demonstrations and validation of the platform's core methodology.\n\nCurrent development involves refining the research methodology to ensure all identified connections are properly documented and verified. The platform integrates web scraping tools and search capabilities to systematically map professional networks, with particular strength in analyzing LinkedIn profiles, corporate relationships, and documented business interactions.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nA critical insight emerged around the importance of rigorous verification in network analysis. Early work revealed that assumptions based on geographic proximity, industry overlap, or shared organizational affiliations often led to false positives. This led to the establishment of a fundamental principle: **NETV\u00c6RKSANALYSE: Kr\u00e6v dokumenteret kilde for HVER forbindelse. Ingen antagelser. Adskil VERIFICERET (med link) fra SPEKULATIV. Hvis ingen kilde = marker som ubekr\u00e6ftet.**\n\nThe most reliable connection paths typically involve documented professional relationships such as direct reporting structures, board positions, documented meetings, business partnerships, or verified collaborations. Speculative connections based on industry presence or geographic location consistently proved unreliable without concrete evidence.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nSven's communication style is direct, action-oriented, and focused on concrete value rather than formal business language. He follows a \"shipping beats planning\" philosophy and prefers straightforward, results-focused messaging that reflects his identity as an AI-first entrepreneur.\n\nThe network analysis methodology involves systematic research starting with LinkedIn profile scraping to establish baseline professional information, then expanding through documented corporate relationships, industry connections, and verified business interactions. Research queries work most effectively when combining specific names with company affiliations, recent date ranges, and documented relationship types rather than broad industry searches.\n\nFor client outreach, the approach emphasizes demonstrating thorough research and understanding of the target's network and challenges, positioning the platform as solving specific \"warm intro at scale\" problems they face in their professional context.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nThe platform leverages Brightdata2 for web scraping and search capabilities, with particular effectiveness in LinkedIn profile analysis and corporate relationship mapping. Search strategies that combine quoted names with specific company affiliations, date ranges, and relationship types consistently yield better results than generic searches.\n\nResearch methodology draws on frameworks like Malcolm Gladwell's \"Tipping Point\" concepts for categorizing network influencers and connection types. The platform integrates multiple data sources including LinkedIn profiles, corporate websites, SEC filings, and news articles to verify professional relationships and avoid false positives in network mapping.", "019b4bc4-c730-74e1-a12a-4b5f2fd59a18": "**Purpose & context**\n\nSven is developing 6Degrees Recruiting OS, an evidence-based recruitment decision support system built with React/TypeScript. The platform is designed to help recruiters make more informed hiring decisions through a structured 4-step candidate evaluation funnel: Job Context, Shortlist, Evidence Report, and Outreach Protocol. The system operates on a credit-based pricing model where candidates can be unlocked at different stages of the evaluation process.\n\nThe platform emphasizes transparency and human oversight in recruitment decisions, incorporating mandatory disclaimers about the need for human review and algorithm transparency. Key terminology includes \"Match Score\" (for candidate alignment) and \"Evidence Report\" (for detailed candidate profiles), with all outputs featuring confidence badges and proper evidence citation formats.\n\n**Current state**\n\nSven recently completed a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul of the platform to align with technical specifications and executive summary requirements. The updated system includes new shared components like ToastProvider for notifications and ShareModal for link generation, improved form validation, accessibility enhancements with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation, and standardized credit display formatting throughout the application.\n\nThe codebase has been prepared for deployment with proper git version control, detailed commit messages, and multiple distribution formats (git bundle and ZIP archive) for integration flexibility.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nSven's development stack centers on React/TypeScript for the frontend, with git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting (https://github.com/Arnarsson/RecruitOS). The project utilizes modern web development practices including proper component architecture, TypeScript typing, and accessibility standards compliance."}, "account_uuid": "e6a8af49-2500-4bf1-9f35-351d2c75dbcb"}]
