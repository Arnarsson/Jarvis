# Jarvis Exclusion Rules
# =====================
#
# Applications and window titles listed here will NEVER be captured.
# This protects your sensitive information from being recorded.
#
# How matching works:
# - app_names: Case-insensitive substring match against application name
# - window_titles: Case-insensitive substring match against window title
#
# Example: "1password" matches "1Password", "1Password 8", etc.
#
# Add your banking apps, password managers, or any sensitive applications
# to this list.

# Applications to exclude (by name)
app_names:
  # Password managers
  - "1password"
  - "bitwarden"
  - "lastpass"
  - "keepass"
  - "keepassxc"
  - "keychain access"  # macOS Keychain
  - "gnome-keyring"
  - "seahorse"  # GNOME Passwords and Keys

  # Add your banking apps here:
  # - "chase"
  # - "wells fargo"
  # - "bank of america"

# Window titles to exclude (substring match)
window_titles:
  # Private browsing modes
  - "private browsing"  # Firefox
  - "incognito"         # Chrome
  - "inprivate"         # Edge
